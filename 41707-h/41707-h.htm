<h3><a id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The most remarkable feature of the character
of the Persian people is their love of Metaphysical
speculation. Yet the inquirer who approaches
the extant literature of Persia expecting to
find any comprehensive systems of thought,
like those of Kapila or Kant, will have to
turn back disappointed, though deeply impressed
by the wonderful intellectual subtlety displayed
therein. It seems to me that the Persian mind
is rather impatient of detail, and consequently
destitute of that organising faculty which
gradually works out a system of ideas, by
interpreting the fundamental principles with
reference to the ordinary facts of observation.
The subtle Brahman sees the inner unity of
things; so does the Persian. But while the
former endeavours to discover it in all the
aspects of human experience, and illustrates its
hidden presence in the concrete in various
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_viii"></a><a href="images/viii.png" class="pgno">[Pg viii]</a></span>
ways, the latter appears to be satisfied with
a bare universality, and does not attempt to
verify the richness of its inner content. The
butterfly imagination of the Persian flies,
half-inebriated as it were, from flower to
flower, and seems to be incapable of reviewing
the garden as a whole. For this reason his
deepest thoughts and emotions find expression
mostly in disconnected verses (<span class="u">Gh</span>azal) which
reveal all the subtlety of his artistic soul. The
Hindū, while admitting, like the Persian, the
necessity of a higher source of knowledge,
yet calmly moves from experience to experience,
mercilessly dissecting them, and forcing them
to yield their underlying universality. In fact
the Persian is only half-conscious of Metaphysics
as a <i>system</i> of thought; his Brahman brother,
on the other hand, is fully alive to the need
of presenting his theory in the form of a
thoroughly reasoned out system. And the
result of this mental difference between the
two nations is clear. In the one case we
have only partially worked out systems of
thought; in the other case, the awful sublimity
of the searching Vedānta. The student of Islamic
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_ix"></a><a href="images/ix.png" class="pgno">[Pg ix]</a></span>
Mysticism who is anxious to see an all-embracing
exposition of the principle of Unity, must look
up the heavy volumes of the Andalūsian Ibn
al-‘Arabī, whose profound teaching stands in
strange contrast with the dry-as-dust Islam of
his countrymen.</p>

<p>The results, however, of the intellectual
activity of the different branches of the great
Aryan family are strikingly similar. The outcome
of all Idealistic speculation in India is Buddha,
in Persia Bahāullah, and in the west Schopenhauer
whose system, in Hegelian language, is
the marriage of free oriental universality with
occidental determinateness.</p>

<p>But the history of Persian thought presents
a phenomenon peculiar to itself. In Persia,
due perhaps to <ins class="mycorr" title="samitic">semitic</ins> influences, philosophical
speculation has indissolubly associated itself
with religion, and thinkers in new lines of
thought have almost always been founders of
new religious movements. After the Arab
conquest, however, we see pure Philosophy
severed from religion by the Neo-Platonic
Aristotelians of Islam, but the severance was
only a transient phenomenon. Greek philosophy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_x"></a><a href="images/x.png" class="pgno">[Pg x]</a></span>
though an exotic plant in the soil of Persia,
eventually became an integral part of Persian
thought; and later thinkers, critics as well as
advocates of Greek wisdom, talked in the
philosophical language of Aristotle and Plato,
and were mostly influenced by religious presuppositions.
It is necessary to bear this fact
in mind in order to gain a thorough understanding
of post-Islamic Persian thought.</p>

<p>The object of this investigation is, as will
appear, to prepare a ground-work for a future
history of Persian Metaphysics. Original thought
cannot be expected in a review, the object
of which is purely historical; yet I venture
to claim some consideration for the following
two points:—</p>

<p>(a) I have endeavoured to trace the logical
continuity of Persian thought, which I have
tried to interpret in the language of modern
Philosophy. This, as far as I know, has not
yet been done.</p>

<p>(b) I have discussed the subject of Ṣūfīism
in a more scientific manner, and have attempted
to bring out the intellectual conditions which
necessitated such a phenomenon. In opposition,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_xi"></a><a href="images/xi.png" class="pgno">[Pg xi]</a></span>
therefore, to the generally accepted view I
have tried to maintain that Ṣūfīism is a
necessary product of the play of various
intellectual and moral forces which would
necessarily awaken the slumbering soul to a
higher ideal of life.</p>

<p>Owing to my ignorance of Zend, my
knowledge of Zoroaster is merely second-hand.
As regards the second part of my work, I
have been able to look up the original Persian
and Arabic manuscripts as well as many
printed works connected with my investigation.
I give below the names of Arabic and Persian
manuscripts from which I have drawn most
of the material utilized here. The method of
transliteration adopted is the one recognised
by the Royal Asiatic Society.</p>

<span>PERSIAN DUALISM.</span></h3>

<h4>§ I.<br /><br />
<a id="Zoroaster"></a>Zoroaster.</h4>

<p>To Zoroaster—the ancient sage of Iran—must
always be assigned the first place in the
intellectual history of Iranian Aryans who,
wearied of constant roaming, settled down to
an agricultural life at a time when the Vedic
Hymns were still being composed in the plains
of Central Asia. This new mode of life and
the consequent stability of the institution of
property among the settlers, made them hated
by other Aryan tribes who had not yet shaken
off their original nomadic habits, and occasionally
plundered their more civilised kinsmen.
Thus grew up the conflict between the two
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_2"></a><a href="images/2.png" class="pgno">[Pg 2]</a></span>
modes of life which found its earliest expression
in the denunciation of the deities of each
other—the Devas and the Ahuras. It was
really the beginning of a long individualising
process which gradually severed the Iranian
branch from other Aryan tribes, and finally
manifested itself in the religious system of
Zoroaster<a id="FNanchor_2:1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_2:1_1" class="fnanchor">[2:1]</a>—the great prophet of Iran who
lived and taught in the age of Solon and
Thales. In the dim light of modern oriental
research we see ancient Iranians divided between
two camps—partisans of the powers of good,
and partisans of the powers of evil—when
the great sage joins their furious contest, and
with his moral enthusiasm stamps out once
for all the worship of demons as well as the
intolerable ritual of the Magian priesthood.</p>

<p>It is, however, beside our purpose to trace
the origin and growth of Zoroaster's religious
system. Our object, in so far as the present
investigation is concerned, is to glance at the
metaphysical side of his revelation. We, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_3"></a><a href="images/3.png" class="pgno">[Pg 3]</a></span>
wish to fix our attention on the sacred
trinity of philosophy—God, Man and
Nature.</p>

<p>Geiger, in his "Civilisation of Eastern Iranians
in Ancient Times", points out that Zoroaster
inherited two fundamental principles from
his Aryan ancestry.—(1) There is law in
Nature. (2) There is conflict in Nature. It is
the observation of law and conflict in the vast
panorama of being that constitutes the philosophical
foundation of his system. The problem
before him was to reconcile the existence of
evil with the eternal goodness of God. His
predecessors worshipped a plurality of good
spirits all of which he reduced to a unity and
called it Ahuramazda. On the other hand he
reduced all the powers of evil to a similar
unity and called it Druj-Ahriman. Thus by a
process of unification he arrived at two fundamental
principles which, as Haug shows, he
looked upon not as two independent activities,
but as two parts or rather aspects of the same
Primary Being. Dr. Haug, therefore, holds
that the Prophet of ancient Iran was theologically
a monotheist and philosophically a
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_4"></a><a href="images/4.png" class="pgno">[Pg 4]</a></span>
dualist.<a id="FNanchor_4:1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:1_2" class="fnanchor">[4:1]</a> But to maintain that there are "twin"<a id="FNanchor_4:2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:2_3" class="fnanchor">[4:2]</a>
spirits—creators of reality and nonreality—and
at the same time to hold that these two
spirits are united in the Supreme Being,<a id="FNanchor_4:3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:3_4" class="fnanchor">[4:3]</a> is
virtually to say that the principle of evil constitutes
a part of the very essence of God;
and the conflict between good and evil is
nothing more than the struggle of God against
Himself. There is, therefore, an inherent weakness
in his attempt to reconcile theological
monotheism with philosophical dualism, and
the result was a schism among the prophet's
followers. The Zendiks<a id="FNanchor_4:4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4:4_5" class="fnanchor">[4:4]</a> whom Dr. Haug calls
heretics, but who were, I believe, decidedly
more consistent than their opponents, maintained
the independence of the two original spirits
from each other, while the Magi upheld their
unity. The upholders of unity endeavoured, in
various ways, to meet the Zendiks; but the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_5"></a><a href="images/5.png" class="pgno">[Pg 5]</a></span>
very fact that they tried different phrases and
expressions to express the unity of the "Primal
Twins", indicates dissatisfaction with their own
philosophical explanations, and the strength
of their opponent's position. <span class="u">Sh</span>ahrastānī<a id="FNanchor_5:1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:1_6" class="fnanchor">[5:1]</a> describes
briefly the different explanations of the
Magi. The Zarwānians look upon Light and
Darkness as the sons of Infinite Time. The
Kiyūmar<span class="u">th</span>iyya hold that the original principle
was Light which was afraid of a hostile power,
and it was this thought of an adversary mixed
with fear that led to the birth of Darkness.
Another branch of Zarwānians maintain that
the original principle doubted concerning something
and this doubt produced Ahriman. Ibn
Ḥazm<a id="FNanchor_5:2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:2_7" class="fnanchor">[5:2]</a> speaks of another sect who explained
the principle of Darkness as the obscuration
of a part of the fundamental principle of Light
itself.</p>

<p>Whether the philosophical dualism of Zoroaster
can be reconciled with his monotheism
or not, it is unquestionable that, from a metaphysical
standpoint, he has made a profound
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_6"></a><a href="images/6.png" class="pgno">[Pg 6]</a></span>
suggestion in regard to the ultimate nature
of reality. The idea seems to have influenced
ancient Greek Philosophy<a id="FNanchor_6:1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:1_8" class="fnanchor">[6:1]</a> as well as early
Christian Gnostic speculation, and through the
latter, some aspects of modern western thought.<a id="FNanchor_6:2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:2_9" class="fnanchor">[6:2]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_7"></a><a href="images/7.png" class="pgno">[Pg 7]</a></span>
As a thinker he is worthy of great respect
not only because he approached the problem
of objective multiplicity in a philosophical spirit;
but also because he endeavoured, having been
led to metaphysical dualism, to reduce his
Primary Duality to a higher unity. He seems
to have perceived, what the mystic shoemaker
of Germany perceived long after him, that
the diversity of nature could not be explained
without postulating a principle of negativity
or self-differentiation in the very nature of God.
His immediate successors did not, however,
quite realise the deep significance of their
master's suggestions; but we shall see, as we
advance, how Zoroaster's idea finds a more
spiritualised expression in some of the aspects
of later Persian thought.</p>

<p>Turning now to his Cosmology, his dualism
leads him to bifurcate, as it were, the whole
universe into two departments of being—reality
i.e. the sum of all good creations flowing
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_8"></a><a href="images/8.png" class="pgno">[Pg 8]</a></span>
from the creative activity of the beneficial spirit,
and non-reality<a id="FNanchor_8:1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8:1_10" class="fnanchor">[8:1]</a> i.e. the sum of all evil creations
proceeding from the hostile spirit. The
original conflict of the two spirits is manifested
in the opposing forces of nature, which, therefore,
presents a continual struggle between
the powers of Good and the powers of Evil.
But it should be remembered that nothing
intervenes between the original spirits and their
respective creations. Things are good and bad
because they proceed from good or bad creative
agencies, in their own nature they are
quite indifferent. Zoroaster's conception of creation
is fundamentally different from that of
Plato and Schopenhauer to whom spheres of
empirical reality reflect non-temporal or temporal
ideas which, so to speak, mediate between
Reality and Appearance. There are,
according to Zoroaster, only two categories of
existence, and the history of the universe is
nothing more than a progressive conflict between
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_9"></a><a href="images/9.png" class="pgno">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the forces falling respectively under these
categories. We are, like other things, partakers
of this struggle, and it is our duty to range
ourselves on the side of Light which will
eventually prevail and completely vanquish the
spirit of Darkness. The metaphysics of the
Iranian Prophet, like that of Plato, passes on
into Ethics, and it is in the peculiarity of the
Ethical aspect of his thought that the influence
of his social <ins class="edcorr" title="evironments">environments</ins> is most apparent.</p>

<p>Zoroaster's view of the destiny of the soul
is very simple. The soul, according to him, is
a creation, not a part of God as the votaries
of Mithra<a id="FNanchor_9:1_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:1_11" class="fnanchor">[9:1]</a> afterwards maintained. It had a
beginning in time, but can attain to everlasting
life by fighting against Evil in the earthly
scene of its activity. It is free to choose between
the only two courses of action—good
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_10"></a><a href="images/10.png" class="pgno">[Pg 10]</a></span>
and evil; and besides the power of choice
the spirit of Light has endowed it with the
following faculties:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="ind">1. Conscience<a id="FNanchor_10:1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:1_12" class="fnanchor">[10:1]</a>.</p>

<p class="ind">2. Vital force.</p>

<p class="ind">3. The Soul—The Mind.</p>

<p class="ind">4. The Spirit—Reason.</p>

spirit which acts as a protection of man
in his voyage towards God.</p></div>

<p>The last three<a id="FNanchor_10:3_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_10:3_14" class="fnanchor">[10:3]</a> faculties are united together
after death, and form an indissoluble whole.
The virtuous soul, leaving its home of flesh,
is borne up into higher regions, and has to
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_11"></a><a href="images/11.png" class="pgno">[Pg 11]</a></span>
pass through the following planes of existence:—</p>

<p>We have seen Zoroaster's solution of the
problem of diversity, and the theological or
rather philosophical controversy which split up
the Zoroastrian Church. The half-Persian
Mānī—"the founder of Godless community"
as Christians styled him afterwards—agrees
with those Zoroastrians who held the Prophet's
doctrine in its naked form, and approaches
the question in a spirit thoroughly materialistic.
Originally Persian his father emigrated from
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_13"></a><a href="images/13.png" class="pgno">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Hamadān to Babylonia where Mānī was born
in 215 or 216 A.D.—the time when Buddhistic
Missionaries were beginning to preach
Nirvāna to the country of Zoroaster. The
eclectic character of the religious system of
Mānī, its bold extension of the Christian idea
of redemption, and its logical consistency in
holding, as a true ground for an ascetic life,
that the world is essentially evil, made it a
real power which influenced not only Eastern
and Western Christian thought<a id="FNanchor_13:1_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13:1_18" class="fnanchor">[13:1]</a>, but has also
left some dim marks on the development of
metaphysical speculation in Persia. Leaving
the discussion of the sources<a id="FNanchor_13:2_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13:2_19" class="fnanchor">[13:2]</a> of Mānī's religious
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_14"></a><a href="images/14.png" class="pgno">[Pg 14]</a></span>
system to the orientalist, we proceed to
describe and finally to determine the philosophical
value of his doctrine of the origin
of the Phenomenal Universe.</p>

<p>The Paganising gnostic, as Erdmann calls
him, teaches that the variety of things springs
from the mixture of two eternal Principles—Light
and Darkness—which are separate
from and independent of each other. The
Principle of Light connotes ten ideas—Gentleness,
Knowledge, Understanding, Mystery,
Insight, Love, Conviction, Faith, Benevolence
and Wisdom. Similarly the Principle of Darkness
connotes five eternal ideas—Mistiness, Heat,
Fire, Venom, Darkness. Along with these two
primordial principles and connected with each,
Mānī recognises the eternity of space and
earth, each connoting respectively the ideas
of knowledge, understanding, mystery, insight,
breath, air, water, light and fire. In darkness—the
feminine Principle in Nature—were hidden
the elements of evil which, in course of time,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_15"></a><a href="images/15.png" class="pgno">[Pg 15]</a></span>
concentrated and resulted in the composition,
so to speak, of the hideous looking Devil—the
principle of activity. This first born child
of the fiery womb of darkness, attacked the
domain of the King of Light who, in order
to ward off his malicious onslaught, created
the Primal man. A serious conflict ensued between
the two creatures, and resulted in the
complete vanquishment of the Primal Man.
The evil one, then, succeeded in mixing
together the five elements of darkness with
the five elements of light. Thereupon the
ruler of the domain of light ordered some
of his angels to construct the Universe
out of these mixed elements with a view
to free the atoms of light from their imprisonment.
But the reason why darkness was
the first to attack light, is that the latter,
being in its essence good, could not proceed
to start the process of admixture which was
essentially harmful to itself. The attitude of
Mānī's Cosmology, therefore, to the Christian
doctrine of Redemption is similar to that of
Hegelian Cosmology to the doctrine of the
Trinity. To him redemption is a physical process,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_16"></a><a href="images/16.png" class="pgno">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and all procreation, because it protracts the
imprisonment of light, is contrary to the aim
and object of the Universe. The imprisoned
atoms of light are continually set free from
darkness which is thrown down in the unfathomable
ditch round the Universe. The liberated
light, however, passes on to the sun and
the moon whence it is carried by angels to
the region of light—the eternal home of
the King of Paradise—"Pîd i vazargîî"—Father
of greatness.</p>

<p>This is a brief account of Mānī's fantastic
Cosmology.<a id="FNanchor_16:1_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_16:1_20" class="fnanchor">[16:1]</a> He rejects the Zoroastrian hypothesis
of creative agencies to explain the problem
of objective existence. Taking a thoroughly
materialistic view of the question, he ascribes
the phenomenal universe to the <i>mixture</i> of two
independent, eternal principles, one of which
(darkness) is not only a part of the universe—stuff,
but also the source wherein activity resides,
as it were, slumbering, and starts up into being
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_17"></a><a href="images/17.png" class="pgno">[Pg 17]</a></span>
when the favourable moment arrives. The essential
idea of his cosmology, therefore, has a
curious resemblance with that of the great
Hindū thinker Kapila, who accounts for the
production of the universe by the hypothesis
of three gunas, i.e. Sattwa (goodness), Tamas
(darkness), and Rajas (motion or passion) which
mix together to form Nature, when the equilibrium
of the primordial matter (Prakritī) is
upset. Of the various solutions<a id="FNanchor_17:1_21"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17:1_21" class="fnanchor">[17:1]</a> of the problem
of diversity which the Vedāntist solved by
postulating the mysterious power of "Māyā",
and Leibniz, long afterwards, explained by
his doctrine of the Identity of Indiscernibles,
Mānī's solution, though childish, must find a
place in the historical development of philosophical
ideas. Its philosophical value may be
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_18"></a><a href="images/18.png" class="pgno">[Pg 18]</a></span>
insignificant; but one thing is certain, i.e.
Mānī was the first to venture the suggestion
that the Universe is due to the activity of
the Devil, and hence essentially evil—a
proposition which seems to me to be the only
logical justification of a system which preaches
renunciation as the guiding principle of life.
In our own times Schopenhauer has been led
to the same conclusion; though, unlike Mānī,
he supposes the principle of objectification or
individuation—"the sinful bent" of the will
to life—to exist in the very nature of the
Primal Will and not independent of it.</p>

<p>Turning now to the remarkable socialist of
ancient Persia—<i>Mazdak</i>. This early prophet
of communism appeared during the reign of
Anū<span class="u">sh</span>īrwān the Just (531:578 A.D.), and
marked another dualistic reaction against the
prevailing Zarwānian doctrine<a id="FNanchor_18:1_22"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18:1_22" class="fnanchor">[18:1]</a>. Mazdak, like
Mānī, taught that the diversity of things springs
from the mixture of two independent, eternal
principles which he called <span class="u">Sh</span>īd (Light) and
Tār (Darkness). But he differs from his predecessor
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_19"></a><a href="images/19.png" class="pgno">[Pg 19]</a></span>
in holding that the fact of their mixture
as well as their final separation, are quite
accidental, and not at all the result of choice.
Mazdak's God is endowed with sensation, and
has four principal energies in his eternal
presence—power of discrimination, memory,
understanding and bliss. These four energies
have four personal manifestations who, assisted
by four other persons, superintend the course
of the Universe. Variety in things and men
is due to the various combinations of the
original principles.</p>

<p>But the most characteristic feature of the
Mazdakite teaching is its communism, which
is evidently an inference from the cosmopolitan
spirit of Mānī's Philosophy. All men, said
Mazdak, are equal; and the notion of individual
property was introduced by the hostile
demons whose object is to turn God's Universe
into a scene of endless misery. It is chiefly
this aspect of Mazdak's teaching that was most
shocking to the Zoroastrian conscience, and
finally brought about the destruction of his
enormous following, even though the master
was supposed to have miraculously made the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_20"></a><a href="images/20.png" class="pgno">[Pg 20]</a></span>
sacred Fire talk, and bear witness to the
truth of his mission.</p>

<h4>§ III.<br /><br />
<a id="Retrospect"></a>Retrospect.</h4>

<p>We have seen some of the aspects of Pre-Islamic
Persian thought; though, owing to
our ignorance of the tendencies of Sāssānīde
thought, and of the political, social, and intellectual
conditions that determined its evolution,
we have not been able fully to trace the
continuity of ideas. Nations as well as individuals,
in their intellectual history, begin with
the objective. Although the moral fervour of
Zoroaster gave a spiritual tone to his theory
of the origin of things, yet the net result of
this period of Persian speculation is nothing
more than a materialistic dualism. The principle
of Unity as a philosophical ground of all that
exists, is but dimly perceived at this stage of
intellectual evolution in Persia. The controversy
among the followers of Zoroaster indicates
that the movement towards a monistic conception
of the Universe had begun; but we
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_21"></a><a href="images/21.png" class="pgno">[Pg 21]</a></span>
have unfortunately no evidence to make a
positive statement concerning the pantheistic
tendencies of Pre-Islamic Persian thought. We
know that in the 6<sup>th</sup> century A.D., Diogenes,
Simplicius and other Neo-Platonic thinkers,
were driven by the persecution of Justinian,
to take refuge in the court of the tolerant
Anū<span class="u">sh</span>īrwān. This great monarch, moreover,
had several works translated for him from
Sanskrit and Greek, but we have no historical
evidence to show how far these events actually
influenced the course of Persian thought. Let
us, therefore, pass on to the advent of Islām
in Persia, which completely shattered the old
order of things, and brought to the thinking
mind the new concept of an uncompromising
monotheism as well as the Greek dualism of
God and matter, as distinguished from the
purely Persian dualism of God and Devil.</p>

In connection with the influence of Zoroastrian ideas on
Ancient Greek thought, the following statement made by Erdmann
is noteworthy, though Lawrence Mills (American Journal of Philology
Vol. 22) regards such influence as improbable:—"The
fact that the handmaids of this force, which he (Heraclitus) calls
the seed of all that happens and the measure of all order, are
entitled the "tongues" has probably been slightly ascribed to the
influence of the Persian Magi. On the other hand he connects
himself with his country's mythology, not indeed without a change
of exegesis when he places Apollo and Dionysus beside Zeus, i.e.
The ultimate fire, as the two aspects of his nature". History of
Philosophy Vol. I, p. 50.
</p>
<p>
It is, perhaps, owing to this doubtful influence of Zoroastrianism
on Heraclitus that Lassalle (quoted by Paul Janet in his History
of the Problems of Philosophy Vol. II, p. 147) looks upon Zoroaster
as a precursor of Hegel.
</p><p>
Of Zoroastrian influence on Pythagoras Erdmann says:—
</p><p>
"The fact that the odd numbers are put above the even has
been emphasised by Gladisch in his comparison of the Pythagorian
with the Chinese doctrine, and the fact, moreover, that among
the oppositions we find those of light and darkness, good and
evil, has induced many, in ancient and modern times, to suppose
that they were borrowed from Zoroastrianism." Vol. I, p. 33.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_6:2_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6:2_9"><span class="label">[6:2]</span></a> Among modern English thinkers Mr. Bradley arrives at a
conclusion similar to that of Zoroaster. Discussing the ethical
significance of Bradley's Philosophy, Prof. Sorley says:—"Mr.
Bradley, like Green, has faith in an eternal reality which might
be called spiritual, inasmuch as it is not material; like Green he
looks upon man's moral activity as an appearance—what Green
calls a reproduction—of this eternal reality. But under this
general agreement there lies a world of difference. He refuses by
the use of the term self-conscious, to liken his Absolute to the
personality of man, and he brings out the consequence which in
Green is more or less concealed, that the evil equally with the
good in man and in the world are appearances of the Absolute".
Recent tendencies in Ethics, pp. 100–101.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_8:1_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8:1_10"><span class="label">[8:1]</span></a> This should not be confounded with Plato's non-being. To
Zoroaster all forms of existence proceeding from the creative
agency of the spirit of darkness are unreal; because, considering
the final triumph of the spirit of Light, they have a temporary
existence only.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_9:1_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9:1_11"><span class="label">[9:1]</span></a> Mithraism was a phase of Zoroastrianism which spread over
the Roman world in the second century. The partisans of Mithra
worshipped the sun whom they looked upon as the great advocate
of Light. They held the human soul to be a part of God, and
maintained that the observance of a mysterious cult could bring
about the souls' union with God. Their doctrine of the soul, its
ascent towards God by torturing the body and finally passing
through the sphere of Aether and becoming pure fire, offers some
resemblance with views entertained by some schools of Persian
Ṣūfīism.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_10:1_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10:1_12"><span class="label">[10:1]</span></a> Geiger's Civilisation of Eastern Iranians, Vol. I, p. 124.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_10:2_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10:2_13"><span class="label">[10:2]</span></a> Dr. Haug (Essays p. 206) compares these protecting spirits
with the ideas of Plato. They, however, are not to be understood
as models according to which things are fashioned. Plato's ideas,
moreover, are eternal, non-temporal and non-spatial. The doctrine
that everything created by the spirit of Light is protected by a
subordinate spirit has only an outward resemblance with the view
that every spirit is fashioned according to a perfect supersensible
model.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_10:3_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10:3_14"><span class="label">[10:3]</span></a> The Ṣūfī conception of the soul is also tripartite. According
to them the soul is a combination of Mind, heart and spirit (Nafs,
Qalb, Rūḥ). The "heart" is to them both material and immaterial
or, more properly, neither—standing midway between soul and
mind (Nafs and Rūḥ), and acting as the organ of higher knowledge.
Perhaps Dr. Schenkel's use of the word "conscience" would
approach the ṣūfī idea of "heart".</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_11:1_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11:1_15"><span class="label">[11:1]</span></a> Geiger Vol. I, p. 104. (The ṣūfī Cosmology has a similar
doctrine concerning the different stages of existence through
which the soul has to pass in its journey heavenward. They enumerate
the following five Planes; but their definition of the
character of each plane is slightly different:—
</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>1. The world of body. (Nāsūt).

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_13:2_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13:2_19"><span class="label">[13:2]</span></a> Some Eastern sources of information about Mānī's Philosophy
(e.g. Ephraim Syrus mentioned by Prof. A. A. Bevan in his Introduction
to the Hymn of the Soul) tell us that he was a disciple
of Bardesanes, the Syrian gnostic. The learned author of
"al-Fihrist", however, mentions some books which Mānī wrote
against the followers of the Syrian gnostic. Burkitt, in his lectures
on Early Eastern Christianity, gives a free translation of Bardesanes'
De Fato, the spirit of which I understand, is fully Christian,
and thoroughly opposed to the teaching of Mānī. Ibn Ḥazm,
however, in his Kitāb al-Milal w’al-Niḥal (Vol. II, p. 36) says,
"Both agreed in other respects, except that Mānī believed darkness
to be a living principle."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_16:1_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16:1_20"><span class="label">[16:1]</span></a> It is interesting to compare Mānī's Philosophy of Nature with
the Chinese notion of Creation, according to which all that exists
flows from the Union of Yin and Yang. But the Chinese reduced
these two principles to a higher unity:—Tai Keih. To Mānī such
a reduction was not possible; since he could not conceive that
things of opposite nature could proceed from the same principle.</p></div>

<span>Greek Dualism.</span></h2>

<h3><a id="CHAP_II"></a><span>CHAP. II.</span><br /><br />
<span>THE NEO-PLATONIC ARISTOTELIANS OF PERSIA.</span></h3>

<p>With the Arab conquest of Persia, a new
era begins in the history of Persian thought.
But the warlike sons of sandy Arabia whose
swords terminated, at Nahāwand, the political
independence of this ancient people, could
hardly touch the intellectual freedom of the
converted Zoroastrian.</p>

<p>The political revolution brought about by
the Arab conquest marks the beginning of
interaction between the Aryan and the Semitic,
and we find that the Persian, though he lets
the surface of his life become largely semitised,
quietly converts Islām to his own Aryan habits of
thought. In the west the sober Hellenic intellect
interpreted another Semitic religion—Christianity;
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_23"></a><a href="images/23.png" class="pgno">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and the results of interpretation in both
cases are strikingly similar. In each case the
aim of the interpreting intellect is to soften
the extreme rigidity of an absolute law imposed
on the individual from without; in one word
it is an endeavour to internalise the external.
This process of transformation began with the
study of Greek thought which, though combined
with other causes, hindered the growth of
native speculation, yet marked a transition
from the purely objective attitude of Pre-Islamic
Persian Philosophy to the subjective attitude
of later thinkers. It is, I believe, largely due
to the influence of foreign thought that the
old monistic tendency when it reasserted itself
about the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> century, assumed a
much more spiritual aspect; and, in its later
development, revivified and spiritualised the
old Iranian dualism of Light and Darkness.
The fact, therefore, that Greek thought roused
into fresh life the subtle Persian intellect, and
largely contributed to, and was finally assimilated
by the general course of intellectual
evolution in Persia, justifies us in briefly running
over, even though at the risk of repetition,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_24"></a><a href="images/24.png" class="pgno">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the systems of the Persian Neo-Platonists who,
as such, deserve very little attention in a history
of purely Persian thought.</p>

<p>It must, however, be remembered that Greek
wisdom flowed towards the Moslem east through
Ḥarrān and Syria. The Syrians took up the
latest Greek speculation i.e. Neo-Platonism
and transmitted to the Moslem what they believed
to be the real philosophy of Aristotle.
It is surprising that Mohammedan Philosophers,
Arabs as well as Persians, continued wrangling
over what they believed to be the real teaching
of Aristotle and Plato, and it never occurred
to them that for a thorough comprehension
of their Philosophies, the knowledge of Greek
language was absolutely necessary. So great
was their ignorance that an epitomised translation
of the Enneads of Plotinus was accepted
as "Theology of Aristotle". It took them centuries
to arrive at a clear conception of the
two great masters of Greek thought; and it
is doubtful whether they ever completely understood
them. Avicenna is certainly clearer and
more original than Al-Fārābī and Ibn Maskawaih;
and the Andelusian Averroes, though
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_25"></a><a href="images/25.png" class="pgno">[Pg 25]</a></span>
he is nearer to Aristotle than any of his
predecessors, is yet far from a complete grasp
of Aristotle's Philosophy. It would, however,
be unjust to accuse them of servile imitation.
The history of their speculation is one continuous
attempt to wade through a hopeless
mass of absurdities that careless translators of
Greek Philosophy had <ins class="mycorr" title="intruduced">introduced</ins>. They had
largely to rethink the Philosophies of Aristotle
and Plato. Their commentaries constitute, so
to speak, an effort at discovery, not exposition.
The very circumstances which left them
no time to think out independent systems of
thought, point to a subtle mind, unfortunately
cabined and cribbed by a heap of obstructing
nonsense that patient industry had gradually
to eliminate, and thus to winnow out truth
from falsehood. With these preliminary remarks
we proceed to consider Persian students of
Greek Philosophy individually.</p>

<a id="Ibn_Maskawaih"></a>Ibn Maskawaih<a id="FNanchor_26:1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_26:1_23" class="fnanchor">[26:1]</a> (d. 1030).</h4>

who was a Turk, and the Physician Rāzī
(d. 932 A.D.) who, true to his Persian habits
of thought, looked upon light as the first
creation, and admitted the eternity of matter,
space and time, we come to the illustrious
name of Abu ‘Alī Muhammad ibn Muhammad
ibn Ya‘qūb, commonly known as <i>Ibn Maskawaih</i>—the
treasurer of the Buwaihid Sultān
‘Ad̤aduddaula—one of the most eminent
theistic thinkers, physicians, moralists and historians
of Persia. I give below a brief account
of his system from his well known work Al-Fauz
al-Aṣ<span class="u">gh</span>ar, published in Beirūt.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_27"></a><a href="images/27.png" class="pgno">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<h5>1. <i>The existence of the ultimate principle.</i></h5>

<p>Here Ibn Maskawaih follows Aristotle, and
reproduces his argument based on the fact of
physical motion. All bodies have the inseparable
property of motion which covers all forms of
change, and does not proceed from the nature
of bodies themselves. Motion, therefore, demands
an external source or prime mover. The supposition
that motion may constitute the very
essence of bodies, is contradicted by experience.
Man, for instance, has the power of free movement;
but, on the supposition, different parts
of his body must continue to move even after
they are severed from one another. The series
of moving causes, therefore, must stop at a
cause which, itself immovable, moves everything
else. The immobility of the Primal cause
is essential; for the supposition of motion in
the Primal cause would necessitate infinite
regress, which is absurd.</p>

<p>The immovable mover is one. A multiplicity
of original movers must imply something
common in their nature, so that they might
be brought under the same category. It must
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_28"></a><a href="images/28.png" class="pgno">[Pg 28]</a></span>
also imply some point of difference in order
to distinguish them from each other. But this
partial identity and difference necessitate composition
in their respective essences; and composition,
being a form of motion, cannot, as
we have shown, exist in the first cause of
motion. The prime mover again is eternal and
immaterial. Since transition from non-existence
to existence is a form of motion; and since
matter is always subject to some kind of motion,
it follows that a thing which is not eternal,
or is, in any way, associated with matter,
must be in motion.</p>

<h5>2. <i>The Knowledge of the Ultimate.</i></h5>

<p>All human knowledge begins from sensations
which are gradually transformed into perceptions.
The earlier stages of intellection are
completely conditioned by the presence of
external reality. But the progress of knowledge
means to be able to think without being
conditioned by matter. Thought begins with
matter, but its object is to gradually free itself
from the primary condition of its own possibility.
A higher stage, therefore, is reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_29"></a><a href="images/29.png" class="pgno">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in imagination—the power to reproduce and
retain in the mind the copy or image of a
thing without reference to the external objectivity
of the thing itself. In the formation of
concepts thought reaches a still higher stage
in point of freedom from materiality; though
the concept, in so far as it is the result of
comparison and assimilation of percepts, cannot
be regarded as having completely freed itself
from the gross cause of sensations. But the
fact that conception is based on perception,
should not lead us to ignore the great difference
between the nature of the concept and
the percept. The individual (percept) is undergoing
constant change which affects the
character of the knowledge founded on mere
perception. The knowledge of individuals, therefore,
lacks the element of permanence. The
universal (concept), on the other hand, is not
affected by the law of change. Individuals
change; the universal remains intact. It is the
essence of matter to submit to the law of
change: the freer a thing is from matter, the
less liable it is to change. God, therefore,
being absolutely free from matter, is absolutely
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_30"></a><a href="images/30.png" class="pgno">[Pg 30]</a></span>
changeless; and it is His complete freedom
from materiality that makes our conception of
Him difficult or impossible. The object of all
philosophical training is to develop the power
of "ideation" or contemplation on pure concepts,
in order that constant practice might make
possible the conception of the absolutely
immaterial.</p>

<h5>3. <i>How the one creates the many.</i></h5>

<p>In this connection it is necessary, for the
sake of clearness, to divide Ibn Maskawaih's
investigations into two parts:—</p>

<p>(a) <i>That the ultimate agent or cause created
the Universe out of nothing.</i> Materialists, he
says, hold the eternity of matter, and attribute
form to the creative activity of God. It is,
however, admitted that when matter passes
from one form into another form, the previous
form becomes absolutely non-existent. For if
it does not become absolutely non-existent,
it must either pass off into some other body,
or continue to exist in the same body. The
first alternative is contradicted by every day
experience. If we transform a ball of wax into
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_31"></a><a href="images/31.png" class="pgno">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a solid square, the original rotundity of the
ball does not pass off into some other body.
The second alternative is also impossible; for
it would necessitate the conclusion that two
contradictory forms e.g. circularity and length,
can exist in the same body. It, therefore,
follows that the original form passes into
absolute non-existence, when the new form
comes into being. This argument proves conclusively
that attributes i.e., form, color, etc.,
come into being from pure nothing. In order
to understand that the substance is also non-eternal
like the attribute, we should grasp the
truth of the following propositions:—</p>

<p>1. The analysis of matter results in a number
of different elements, the diversity of which is
reduced to one simple element.</p>

<p>2. Form and matter are inseparable: no
change in matter can annihilate form.</p>

<p>From these two propositions, Ibn Maskawaih
concludes that the substance had a beginning
in time. Matter like form must have begun
to exist; since the eternity of matter necessitates
the eternity of form which, as we have
seen, cannot be regarded as eternal.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_32"></a><a href="images/32.png" class="pgno">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>(b) <i>The process of creation.</i> What is the
cause of this immense diversity which meets
us on all sides? How could the many be created
by one? When, says the Philosopher, one
cause produces a number of different effects,
their multiplicity may depend on any of the
following reasons:—</p>

<p>1. The cause may have various powers.
Man, for instance, being a combination of various
elements and powers, may be the cause of
various actions.</p>

<p>2. The cause may use various means to
produce a variety of effects.</p>

<p>3. The cause may work upon a variety of
material.</p>

<p>None of these propositions can be true of
the nature of the ultimate cause—God. That
he possesses various powers, distinct from one
another, is manifestly absurd; since his nature
does not admit of composition. If he is supposed
to have employed different means to produce
diversity, who is the creator of these means?
If these means are due to the creative agency
of some cause other than the ultimate cause,
there would be a plurality of ultimate causes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_33"></a><a href="images/33.png" class="pgno">[Pg 33]</a></span>
If, on the other hand, the Ultimate Cause
himself created these means, he must have
required other means to create these means.
The third proposition is also inadmissible as
a conception of the creative act. The many
cannot flow from the causal action of one
agent. It, therefore, follows that we have only
one way out of the difficulty—that the ultimate
cause created only one thing which led
to the creation of another. Ibn Maskawaih
here enumerates the usual Neo-Platonic emanations
gradually growing grosser and grosser
until we reach the primordial elements, which
combine and recombine to evolve higher and
higher forms of life. <span class="u">Sh</span>iblī thus sums up Ibn
Maskawaih's theory of evolution<a id="FNanchor_33:1_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_33:1_25" class="fnanchor">[33:1]</a>:—</p>

<p>"The combination of primary substances
produced the mineral kingdom, the lowest form
of life. A higher stage of evolution is reached
in the vegetable kingdom. The first to appear
is spontaneous grass; then plants and various
kinds of trees, some of which touch the border-land
of animal kingdom, in so far as they
manifest certain animal characteristics. Intermediary
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_34"></a><a href="images/34.png" class="pgno">[Pg 34]</a></span>
between the vegetable kingdom and
the animal kingdom there is a certain form
of life which is neither animal nor vegetable,
but shares the characteristics of both (e.g.
coral). The first step beyond this intermediary
stage of life, is the development of the power
of movement, and the sense of touch in tiny
worms which crawl upon the earth. The sense
of touch, owing to the process of differentiation,
develops other forms of sense, until we reach
the plane of higher animals in which intelligence
begins to manifest itself in an ascending
scale. Humanity is touched in the ape which
undergoes further development, and gradually
develops erect stature and power of understanding
similar to man. Here animality ends
and humanity begins".</p>

<h5>4. <i>The soul.</i></h5>

<p>In order to understand whether the soul
has an independent existence, we should examine
the nature of human knowledge. It is the
essential property of matter that it cannot
assume two different forms simultaneously. To
transform a silver spoon into a silver glass,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_35"></a><a href="images/35.png" class="pgno">[Pg 35]</a></span>
it is necessary that the spoon-form as such,
should cease to exist. This property is common
to all bodies, and a body that lacks it cannot
be regarded as a body. Now when we examine
the nature of perception, we see that there
is a principle in man which, in so far as it
is able to know more than one thing at a
time, can assume, so to say, many different
forms simultaneously. This principle cannot be
matter, since it lacks the fundamental property
of matter. The essence of the soul consists
in the power of perceiving a number of objects
at one and the same moment of time. But it
may be objected that the soul-principle may
be either material in its essence, or a function
of matter. There are, however, reasons to show
that the soul cannot be a function of matter.</p>

<p>(a). A thing which assumes different forms
and states, cannot itself be one of those forms
and states. A body which receives different
colors should be, in its own nature, colorless.
The soul, in its perception of external objects,
assumes, as it were, various forms and states;
it, therefore, cannot be regarded as one of
those forms. Ibn Maskawaih seems to give no
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_36"></a><a href="images/36.png" class="pgno">[Pg 36]</a></span>
countenance to the contemporary Faculty-Psychology;
to him different mental states are
various transformations of the soul itself.</p>

<p>(b). The attributes are constantly changing;
there must be beyond the sphere of change,
some permanent substratum which is the
foundation of personal identity.</p>

<p>Having shown that the soul cannot be
regarded as a function of matter, Ibn Maskawaih
proceeds to prove that it is essentially
immaterial. Some of his arguments may be
noticed:—</p>

<p>1. The senses, after they have perceived a
strong stimulus, cannot, for a certain amount
of time, perceive a weaker stimulus. It is,
however, quite different with the mental act
of cognition.</p>

<p>2. When we reflect on an abstruse subject,
we endeavour to completely shut our eyes to
the objects around us, which we regard as so
many hindrances in the way of spiritual activity.
If the soul is material in its essence, it need
not, in order to secure unimpeded activity,
escape from the world of matter.</p>

<p>3. The perception of a strong stimulus
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_37"></a><a href="images/37.png" class="pgno">[Pg 37]</a></span>
weakens and sometimes injures the sense. The
intellect, on the other hand, grows in strength
with the knowledge of ideas and general notions.</p>

<p>4. Physical weakness due to old age, does
not affect mental vigour.</p>

<p>5. The soul can conceive certain propositions
which have no connection with the sense-data.
The senses, for instance, cannot perceive
that two contradictories cannot exist together.</p>

<p>6. There is a certain power in us which
rules over physical organs, corrects sense-errors,
and unifies all knowledge. This unifying principle
which reflects over the material brought
before it through the sense-channel, and,
weighing the evidence of each sense, decides
the character of rival statements, must itself
stand above the sphere of matter.</p>

<p>The combined force of these considerations,
says Ibn Maskawaih, conclusively establishes
the truth of the proposition—that the soul
is essentially immaterial. The immateriality of
the soul signifies its immortality; since mortality
is a characteristic of the material.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_38"></a><a href="images/38.png" class="pgno">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<h4>§ II.<br /><br />
<a id="Avicenna"></a>Avicenna (d. 1037).</h4>

<p>Among the early Persian Philosophers, Avicenna
alone attempted to construct his own
system of thought. His work, called "Eastern
Philosophy" is still extant; and there has also
come down to us a fragment<a id="FNanchor_38:1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_38:1_26" class="fnanchor">[38:1]</a> in which the
Philosopher has expressed his views on the
universal operation of the force of love in
nature. It is something like the contour of a
system, and it is quite probable that ideas
expressed therein were afterwards fully
worked out.</p>

<p>Avicenna defines "Love" as the appreciation
of Beauty; and from the standpoint of
this definition he explains that there are three
categories of being:—</p>

<p>1. Things that are at the highest point of
perfection.</p>

<p>2. Things that are at the lowest point of
perfection.</p>

<p>3. Things that stand between the two poles
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_39"></a><a href="images/39.png" class="pgno">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of perfection. But the third category has no
real existence; since there are things that have
already attained the acme of perfection, and
there are others still progressing towards perfection.
This striving for the ideal is love's
movement towards beauty which, according to
Avicenna, is identical with perfection. Beneath
the visible evolution of forms is the force of
love which actualises all striving, movement,
progress. Things are so constituted that they
hate non-existence, and love the joy of individuality
in various forms. The indeterminate
matter, dead in itself, assumes, or more
properly, is made to assume by the inner
force of love, various forms, and rises higher
and higher in the scale of beauty. The operation
of this ultimate force, in the physical
plane, can be thus indicated:—</p>

<p>1. Inanimate objects are combinations of
form, matter and quality. Owing to the working
of this mysterious power, quality sticks to its
subject or substance; and form embraces indeterminate
matter which, impelled by the mighty
force of love, rises from form to form.</p>

<p>2. The tendency of the force of love is to
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_40"></a><a href="images/40.png" class="pgno">[Pg 40]</a></span>
centralise itself. In the vegetable kingdom it
attains a higher degree of unity or centralisation;
though the soul still lacks that unity
of action which it attains afterwards. The
processes of the vegetative soul are:—</p>

<p>(a) Assimilation.</p>

<p>(b) Growth.</p>

<p>(c) Reproduction.</p>

<p>These processes, however, are nothing more
than so many manifestations of love. Assimilation
indicates attraction and transformation
of what is external into what is internal. Growth
is love of achieving more and more harmony
of parts; and reproduction means perpetuation
of the kind, which is only another phase of love.</p>

<p>3. In the animal kingdom, the various
operations of the force of love are still more
unified. It does preserve the vegetable instinct
of acting in different directions; but there is
also the development of temperament which
is a step towards more unified activity. In man
this tendency towards unification manifests itself
in self-consciousness. The same force of "natural
or constitutional love", is working in the life
of beings higher than man. All things are
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_41"></a><a href="images/41.png" class="pgno">[Pg 41]</a></span>
moving towards the first Beloved—the Eternal
Beauty. The worth of a thing is decided by
its nearness to or distance from, this ultimate
principle.</p>

<p>As a physician, however, Avicenna is especially
interested in the nature of the Soul. In
his times, moreover, the doctrine of metempsychosis
was getting more and more popular.
He, therefore, discusses the nature of the
soul, with a view to show the falsity of this
doctrine. It is difficult, he says, to define the
soul; since it manifests different powers and
tendencies in different planes of being. His
view of the various powers of the soul can
be thus represented:—</p>

<p>1. Manifestation as unconscious activity—</p>

</table></div>

<p>In his fragment on "Nafs" (soul) Avicenna
endeavours to show that a material accompaniment
is not necessary to the soul. It is not
through the instrumentality of the body, or
some power of the body, that the soul conceives
or imagines; since if the soul necessarily
requires a physical medium in conceiving other
things, it must require a different body in
order to conceive the body attached to itself.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_43"></a><a href="images/43.png" class="pgno">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Moreover, the fact that the soul is immediately
self conscious—conscious of itself through
itself—conclusively shows that in its essence
the soul is quite independent of any physical
accompaniment. The doctrine of metempsychosis
implies, also, individual pre-existence. But
supposing that the soul did exist before the
body, it must have existed either as one or
as many. The multiplicity of bodies is due to
the multiplicity of material forms, and does
not indicate the multiplicity of souls. On the
other hand, if it existed as one, the ignorance
or knowledge of A must mean the ignorance
or knowledge of B; since the soul is one in
both. These categories, therefore, cannot be
applied to the soul. The truth is, says Avicenna,
that body and soul are contiguous to each
other, but quite opposite in their respective
essences. The disintegration of the body does
not necessitate the annihilation of the soul.
Dissolution or decay is a property of compounds,
and not of simple, indivisible, ideal substances.
Avicenna, then denies pre-existence, and
endeavours to show the possibility of disembodied
conscious life beyond the grave.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_44"></a><a href="images/44.png" class="pgno">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>We have run over the work of the early
Persian Neo-Platonists among whom, as we
have seen, Avicenna alone learned to think
for himself. Of the generations of his disciples—Behmenyār,
Ab u’l-Ma’mūm of Isfahān, Ma‘ṣūmī,
Ab u’l-‘Abbās, Ibn Tāhir<a id="FNanchor_44:1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_44:1_27" class="fnanchor">[44:1]</a>—who carried on
their master's Philosophy, we need not speak.
So powerful was the spell of Avicenna's personality
that, even long after it had been
removed, any amplification or modification of
his views was considered to be an unpardonable
crime. The old Iranian idea of the dualism
of Light and Darkness, does not act as a
determining factor in the progress of Neo-Platonic
ideas in Persia, which borrowed independent
life for a time, and eventually merged
their separate existence in the general current
of Persian speculation. They are, therefore,
connected with the course of indigenous thought
only in so far as they contributed to the
strength and expansion of that monistic
tendency, which manifested itself early in the
Church of Zoroaster; and, though for a time
hindered by the Theological controversies of
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_45"></a><a href="images/45.png" class="pgno">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Islām, burst out with redoubled force in later
times, to extend its titanic grasp to all the
previous intellectual achievements of the land
of its birth.</p>

<span>THE RISE AND FALL OF RATIONALISM IN ISLĀM.</span></h3>

<h4>§ I.<br /><br />
<a id="Metaphysics_of_Rationalism"></a>The Metaphysics of Rationalism—Materialism.</h4>

<p>The Persian mind, having adjusted itself to
the new political environment, soon reasserts
its innate freedom, and begins to retire from
the field of objectivity, in order that it may
come back to itself, and reflect upon the
material achieved in its journey out of its own
inwardness. With the study of Greek thought,
the spirit which was almost lost in the concrete,
begins to reflect and realise itself as the arbiter
of truth. Subjectivity asserts itself, and endeavours
to supplant all outward authority. Such
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_46"></a><a href="images/46.png" class="pgno">[Pg 46]</a></span>
a period, in the intellectual history of a people,
must be the epoch of rationalism, scepticism,
mysticism, heresy—forms in which the human
mind, swayed by the growing force of subjectivity,
rejects all external standards of truth.
And so we find the epoch under consideration.</p>

<p>The period of Umayyad dominance is taken
up with the process of co-mingling and adjustment
to new conditions of life; but with the
rise of the ‘Abbāsid Dynasty and the study
of Greek Philosophy, the pent-up intellectual
force of Persia bursts out again, and exhibits
wonderful activity in all the departments of
thought and action. The fresh intellectual
vigour imparted by the assimilation of Greek
Philosophy which was studied with great avidity,
led immediately to a critical examination of
Islamic Monotheism. Theology, enlivened by
religious fervour, learned to talk the language
of Philosophy earlier than cold reason began
to seek a retired corner, away from the noise
of controversy, in order to construct a consistent
theory of things. In the first half of
the 8<sup>th</sup> century we find Wāṣil Ibn ‘Atā—a
Persian disciple of the famous theologian Ḥasan
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_47"></a><a href="images/47.png" class="pgno">[Pg 47]</a></span>
of Baṣra—starting Mu‘tazilaism (Rationalism)—that
most interesting movement which
engaged some of the subtlest minds of Persia,
and finally exhausted its force in the keen
metaphysical controversies of Ba<span class="u">gh</span>dād and
Baṣra. The famous city of Baṣra had become,
owing to its commercial situation, the playground
of various forces—Greek Philosophy,
Scepticism, Christianity, Buddhistic ideas,
Manichaeism<a id="FNanchor_47:1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_47:1_28" class="fnanchor">[47:1]</a>—which furnished ample
spiritual food to the inquiring mind of the
time, and formed the intellectual environment
of Islamic Rationalism. What Spitta calls the
Syrian period of Muhammadan History is not
characterised with metaphysical subtleties. With
the advent of the Persian Period, however,
Muhammadan students of Greek Philosophy
began properly to reflect on their religion;
and the Mu‘tazila thinkers<a id="FNanchor_47:2_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_47:2_29" class="fnanchor">[47:2]</a>, gradually drifted
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_48"></a><a href="images/48.png" class="pgno">[Pg 48]</a></span>
into metaphysics with which alone we are
concerned here. It is not our object to trace
the history of the Mu‘tazila Kalām; for present
purposes it will be sufficient if we briefly
reveal the metaphysical implications of the
Mu‘tazila view of Islām. The conception of
God, and the theory of matter, therefore,
are the only aspects of Rationalism which we
propose to discuss here.</p>

<p>His conception of the unity of God at which
the Mu‘tazila eventually arrived by a subtle
dialectic is one of the fundamental points in
which he differs from the Orthodox Muhammadan.
God's attributes, according to his view,
cannot be said to inhere in him; they form
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_49"></a><a href="images/49.png" class="pgno">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the very essence of His nature. The Mu‘tazila,
therefore, denies the separate reality of divine
attributes, and declares their absolute identity
with the abstract divine Principle. "God", says
Abu’l-Hu<span class="u">dh</span>ail, "is knowing, all-powerful, living;
and his knowledge, power and life constitute
His very essence (<span class="u">dh</span>āt)"<a id="FNanchor_49:1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_49:1_30" class="fnanchor">[49:1]</a>. In order to explain
the pure unity of God Joseph Al-Baṣīr<a id="FNanchor_49:2_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_49:2_31" class="fnanchor">[49:2]</a> lays
down the following five principles:—</p>

<p>(1). The necessary supposition of atom and
accident.</p>

<p>(2). The necessary supposition of a creator.</p>

<p>(3). The necessary supposition of the conditions
(Aḥwāl) of God.</p>

<p>(4). The rejection of those attributes which
do not befit God.</p>

<p>(5). The unity of God in spite of the plurality
of His attributes.</p>

<p>This conception of unity underwent further
modifications; until in the hands of Mu‘ammar
and Abu Hā<span class="u">sh</span>im it became a mere abstract
possibility about which nothing could be predicated.
We cannot, he says, predicate knowledge
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_50"></a><a href="images/50.png" class="pgno">[Pg 50]</a></span>
of God<a id="FNanchor_50:1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_50:1_32" class="fnanchor">[50:1]</a>, for His knowledge must be
of something in Himself. The first necessitates
the identity of subject and object which is
absurd; the second implicates duality in the
nature of God which is equally impossible.
Aḥmad and Faḍl<a id="FNanchor_50:2_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_50:2_33" class="fnanchor">[50:2]</a>—disciples of Nazzām,
however, recognised this duality in holding
that the original creators are two—God—the
eternal principle; and the word of God—Jesus
Christ—the contingent principle. But
more fully to bring out the element of truth
in the second alternative suggested by Mu‘ammar,
was reserved, as we shall see, for later
Ṣūfī thinkers of Persia. It is, therefore, clear
that some of the rationalists almost unconsciously
touched the outer fringe of later
pantheism for which, in a sense, they prepared
the way, not only by their definition of God,
but also by their common effort to internalise
the rigid externality of an absolute law.</p>

<p>But the most important contribution of the
advocates of Rationalism to purely metaphysical
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_51"></a><a href="images/51.png" class="pgno">[Pg 51]</a></span>
speculation, is their explanation of
matter, which their opponents—the Ash‘arite—afterwards
modified to fit in with their own
views of the nature of God. The interest of
Nazzām chiefly consisted in the exclusion of
all arbitrariness from the orderly course of
nature<a id="FNanchor_51:1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:1_34" class="fnanchor">[51:1]</a>. The same interest in naturalism led
Al-Jāḥiẓ to define Will in a purely negative
manner<a id="FNanchor_51:2_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:2_35" class="fnanchor">[51:2]</a>. Though the Rationalist thinkers did
not want to abandon the idea of a Personal
Will, yet they endeavoured to find a deeper
ground for the independence of individual
natural phenomena. And this ground they found
in matter itself. Nazzām taught the infinite
divisibility of matter, and obliterated the
distinction between substance and accident<a id="FNanchor_51:3_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:3_36" class="fnanchor">[51:3]</a>.
Existence was regarded as a quality superimposed
by God on the pre-existing material
atoms which would have been incapable of
perception without this quality. Muḥammad
Ibn ‘U<span class="u">th</span>mān, one of the Mu‘tazila <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>s,
says Ibn Ḥazm,<a id="FNanchor_51:4_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_51:4_37" class="fnanchor">[51:4]</a> maintained that the non-existent
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_52"></a><a href="images/52.png" class="pgno">[Pg 52]</a></span>
(atom in its pre-existential state) is
a body in that state; only that in its pre-existential
condition it is neither in motion,
nor at rest, nor is it said to be created. Substance,
then, is a collection of qualities—taste,
odour, colour—which, in themselves,
are nothing more than material potentialities.
The soul, too, is a finer kind of matter; and
the processes of knowledge are mere mental
motions. Creation is only the actualisation of
pre-existing potentialities<a id="FNanchor_52:1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:1_38" class="fnanchor">[52:1]</a> (Ṭafra). The individuality
of a thing which is defined as "that
of which something can be predicated"<a id="FNanchor_52:2_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:2_39" class="fnanchor">[52:2]</a> is
not an essential factor in its notion. The
collection of things we call the Universe, is
externalised or perceptible reality which could,
so to speak, exist independent of all perceptibility.
The object of these metaphysical subtleties
is purely theological. God, to the Rationalist,
is an absolute unity which can, in no
sense, admit of plurality, and could thus exist
without the perceptible plurality—the Universe.</p>

<p>The activity of God, then, consists only in
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_53"></a><a href="images/53.png" class="pgno">[Pg 53]</a></span>
making the atom perceptible. The properties
of the atom flow from its own nature. A stone
thrown up falls down on account of its own
indwelling property<a id="FNanchor_53:1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:1_40" class="fnanchor">[53:1]</a>. God, says Al-‘Aṭṭār of
Baṣra and Bi<span class="u">sh</span>r ibn al Mu‘tamir, did not create
colour, length, breadth, taste or smell—all
these are activities of bodies themselves<a id="FNanchor_53:2_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:2_41" class="fnanchor">[53:2]</a>.
Even the number of things in the Universe is
not known to God<a id="FNanchor_53:3_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:3_42" class="fnanchor">[53:3]</a>. Bishr ibn al-Mu‘tamir further
explained the properties of bodies by what he
called "Tawallud"—interaction of bodies<a id="FNanchor_53:4_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:4_43" class="fnanchor">[53:4]</a>. Thus
it is clear that the Rationalists were philosophically
materialists, and theologically deists.</p>

<p>To them substance and atom are identical,
and they define substance as a space-filling
atom which, besides the quality of filling space,
has a certain direction, force and existence
forming its very essence as an actuality. In
shape it is squarelike; for if it is supposed to
be circular, combination of different atoms
would not be possible<a id="FNanchor_53:5_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_53:5_44" class="fnanchor">[53:5]</a>. There is, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_54"></a><a href="images/54.png" class="pgno">[Pg 54]</a></span>
great difference of opinion among the exponents
of atomism in regard to the nature of
the atom. Some hold that atoms are all similar
to each other; while Abu’l-Qāsim of Bal<span class="u">kh</span>
regards them as similar as well as dissimilar.
When we say that two things are similar to
each other, we do not <ins class="mycorr" title="necssarily">necessarily</ins> mean that
they are similar in all their attributes. Abu’l-Qāsim
further differs from <ins class="mycorr" title="Nazzān">Nazzām</ins> in advocating
the indestructibility of the atom. He holds that
the atom had a beginning in time; but that it
cannot be completely annihilated. The attribute
of "Baqā" (continued existence), he says, does
not give to its subject a new attribute other
than existence; and the continuity of existence
is not an additional attribute at all. The divine
activity created the atom as well as its continued
existence. Abu’l-Qāsim, however, admits that
some atoms may not have been created for
continued existence. He denies also the existence
of any intervening space between different
atoms, and holds, unlike other representatives
of the school, that the essence or atom (Māhiyyat)
could not remain essence in a state of non-existence.
To advocate the opposite is a contradiction
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_55"></a><a href="images/55.png" class="pgno">[Pg 55]</a></span>
in terms. To say that the essence
(which is essence because of the attribute of
existence) could remain essence in a state of
non-existence, is to say that the existent could
remain existent in a state of non-existence. It is
obvious that Abu’l-Qāsim here approaches the
A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite theory of knowledge which dealt a
serious blow to the Rationalist theory of matter.</p>

<h4>§ II.<br /><br />
<a id="Contemporary_Movements"></a>Contemporary Movements of Thought.</h4>

<p>Side by side with the development of Mu‘tazilaism
we see, as is natural in a period of great
intellectual activity, many other tendencies of
thought manifesting themselves in the philosophical
and religious circles of Islam. Let us
notice them briefly:—</p>

<p>1. Scepticism. The tendency towards scepticism
was the natural consequence of the purely
dialectic method of Rationalism. Men such as
Ibn A<span class="u">sh</span>ras and Al-Jāhiz who apparently belonged
to the Rationalist camp, were really sceptics. The
standpoint of Al-Jāhiz who inclined to deistic
naturalism<a id="FNanchor_55:1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:1_45" class="fnanchor">[55:1]</a>, is that of a cultured man of the
time, and not of a professional theologian. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_56"></a><a href="images/56.png" class="pgno">[Pg 56]</a></span>
him is noticeable also a <ins class="edcorr" title="reation">reaction</ins> against the
metaphysical hairsplitting of his predecessors,
and a desire to widen the pale of theology
for the sake of the illiterate who are incapable
of reflecting on articles of faith.</p>

<p>2. Ṣūfīism—an appeal to a higher source
of knowledge which was first systematised by
<span class="u">Dh</span>u’l-Nūn, and became more and more deepened
and antischolastic in contrast to the dry intellectualism
of the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite. We shall consider this
interesting movement in the following chapter.</p>

<p>3. The revival of authority—Ismā‘īlianism—a
movement characteristically Persian which,
instead of repudiating freethought, endeavours
to come to an understanding with it. Though
this movement seems to have no connection
with the theological controversies of the time,
yet its connection with freethought is fundamental.
The similarity between the methods
practised by the Ismā‘īlian missionaries and
those of the partisans of the association called
I<span class="u">kh</span>wān al-Safā—Brethren of Purity—suggests
some sort of secret relation between the two
institutions. Whatever may be the motive of
those who started this movement, its significance
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_57"></a><a href="images/57.png" class="pgno">[Pg 57]</a></span>
as an intellectual phenomenon should not be
lost sight of. The multiplicity of philosophical
and religious views—a necessary consequence of
speculative activity—is apt to invoke forces
which operate against this, religiously speaking,
dangerous multiplicity. In the 18th century
history of European thought we see Fichte,
starting with a sceptical inquiry concerning
the nature of matter, and finding its last word
in Pantheism. Schleiermacher appeals to Faith
as opposed to Reason, Jacobi points to a
source of knowledge higher than reason, while
Comte abandons all metaphysical inquiry, and
limits all knowledge to sensuous perception.
De Maistre and Schlegel, on the other hand,
find a resting place in the authority of an
absolutely infallible Pope. The advocates of
the doctrine of Imāmat think in the same
strain as De Maistre; but it is curious that
the <ins class="mycorr" title="Ismā‘īliams">Ismā‘īlians</ins>, while making this doctrine the
basis of their Church, permitted free play to
all sorts of thinking.</p>

<p>The Ismā‘īlia movement then is one aspect
of the persistent battle<a id="FNanchor_57:1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_57:1_46" class="fnanchor">[57:1]</a> which the intellectually
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_58"></a><a href="images/58.png" class="pgno">[Pg 58]</a></span>
independent Persian waged against the religious
and political ideals of Islam. Originally a branch
of the Shī‘ite religion, the Ismā‘īlia sect assumed
quite a cosmopolitan character with ‘Abdulla
ibn Maimūn—the probable progenitor of the
Fātimid Caliphs of Egypt—who died about
the same time when Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī, the great
opponent of Freethought, was born. This curious
man imagined a vast scheme in which he
weaved together innumerable threads of various
hues, resulting in a cleverly constructed equivocation,
charming to the Persian mind for its
mysterious character and misty Pythagorean
Philosophy. Like the Association of the Brethren
of Purity, he made an attempt, under the pious
cloak of the doctrine of Imāmat (Authority), to
synthesise all the dominating ideas of the time.
Greek Philosophy, Christianity, Rationalism,
Sūfīism, Manichaeism, Persian heresies, and
above all the idea of reincarnation, all came
forward to contribute their respective shares
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_59"></a><a href="images/59.png" class="pgno">[Pg 59]</a></span>
to the boldly conceived Ismā‘īlian whole, the
various aspects of which were to be gradually
revealed to the initiated, by the "Leader"—the
ever Incarnating Universal Reason—according
to the intellectual development of
the age in which he incarnated himself. In
the Ismā‘īlian movement, Freethought, apprehending
the collapse of its ever widening
structure, seeks to rest upon a stable basis,
and, by a strange irony of fate, is led to find
it in the very idea which is revolting to its
whole being. Barren authority, though still
apt to reassert herself at times, adopts this
unclaimed child, and thus permits herself to
assimilate all knowledge past, present and future.</p>

<p>The unfortunate connection, however, of this
movement with the politics of the time, has misled
many a scholar. They see in it (Macdonald,
for instance) nothing more than a powerful
conspiracy to uproot the political power of
the Arab from Persia. They have denounced
the Ismā‘īlian Church which counted among its
followers some of the best heads and sincerest
hearts, as a mere clique of dark murderers
who were ever watching for a possible victim.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_60"></a><a href="images/60.png" class="pgno">[Pg 60]</a></span>
We must always remember, while estimating the
character of these people, the most barbarous
persecutions which drove them to pay red-handed
fanaticism in the same coin. Assassinations
for religious purposes were considered
unobjectionable, and even perhaps lawful, among
the whole Semite race. As late as the latter
half of the 16th century, the Pope of Rome
could approve such a dreadful slaughter as
the massacre of St. Bartholomew. That assassination,
even though actuated by religious zeal,
is still a crime, is a purely modern idea; and
justice demands that we should not judge older
generations with our own standards of right
and wrong. A great religious movement which
shook to its very foundations the structure of
a vast empire, and, having successfully passed
through the varied ordeals of moral reproach,
calumny and persecution, stood up for centuries
as a champion of Science and Philosophy,
could not have entirely rested on the frail
basis of a political conspiracy of a mere local
and temporary character. Ismā‘īlianism, in spite
of its almost entire loss of original vitality,
still dominates the ethical ideal of not an
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_61"></a><a href="images/61.png" class="pgno">[Pg 61]</a></span>
insignificant number in India, Persia, Central
Asia, Syria and Africa; while the last expression
of Persian thought—Bābism—is
essentially Ismā‘īlian in its character.</p>

<p>To return, however, to the Philosophy of
the sect. From the later Rationalists they
borrowed their conception of Divinity. God,
or the ultimate principle of existence, they
teach, has no attribute. His nature admits
of no predication. When we predicate the
attribute of power to him, we only mean that
He is the giver of power; when we predicate
eternity, we indicate the eternity of what the
Qur’ān calls "Amr" (word of God) as distinguished
from the "<span class="u">Kh</span>alq" (creation of God)
which is contingent. In His nature all contradictions
melt away, and from Him flow all
opposites. Thus they <ins class="edcorr" title="consided">considered</ins> themselves to
have solved the problem which had troubled
the mind of Zoroaster and his followers.</p>

<p>In order to find an answer to the question,
"What is plurality?" the Ismā‘īlia refer to what
they consider a <ins class="mycorr" title="netaphysical">metaphysical</ins> axiom—"that
from one only one can proceed". But the one
which proceeds, is not something completely
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_62"></a><a href="images/62.png" class="pgno">[Pg 62]</a></span>
different from which it proceeds. It is really
the Primal one transformed. The Primal Unity,
therefore, transformed itself into the First
Intellect (Universal Reason); and then, by
means of this transformation of itself, created
the Universal soul which, impelled by
its nature to perfectly identify itself with the
original source, felt the necessity of motion,
and consequently of a body possessing the
power of motion. In order to achieve its end,
the soul created the heavens moving in circular
motion according to its direction. It also created
the elements which mixed together, and formed
the visible Universe—the scene of plurality
through which it endeavours to pass with a
view to come back to the original source. The
individual soul is an epitome of the whole
Universe which exists only for its progressive
education. The Universal Reason incarnates
itself from time to time, in the personality of
the "Leader" who illuminates the soul in proportion
to its experience and understanding, and
gradually guides it through the scene of plurality
to the world of eternal unity. When the Universal
soul reaches its goal, or rather returns to its
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_63"></a><a href="images/63.png" class="pgno">[Pg 63]</a></span>
own deep being, the process of disintegration
ensues. "Particles constituting the Universe
fall off from each other—those of goodness
go to truth (God) which symbolises unity; those
of evil go to untruth (Devil) which symbolises
diversity"<a id="FNanchor_63:1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_63:1_47" class="fnanchor">[63:1]</a>. This is but briefly the Ismā‘īlian
Philosophy—a mixture, as <span class="u">Sh</span>arastānī remarks,
of Philosophical and Manichaean ideas—<ins class="mycorr" title="which.">which,</ins>
by gradually arousing the slumbering spirit of
scepticism, they administered, as it were, in
doses to the initiated, and finally brought them
to that stage of spiritual emancipation where
solemn ritual drops off, and dogmatic religion
appears to be nothing more than a systematic
arrangement of useful falsehoods.</p>

<p>The Ismā‘īlian doctrine is the first attempt
to amalgamate contemporary Philosophy with
a really Persian view of the Universe, and
to restate Islam, in reference to this synthesis,
by allegorical interpretation of the Qur’ān—a
method which was afterwards adopted by
Ṣūfīism. With them the Zoroastrian Ahriman
(Devil) is not the malignant creator of evil
things but it is a principle which violates the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_64"></a><a href="images/64.png" class="pgno">[Pg 64]</a></span>
eternal unity, and breaks it up into visible
diversity. The idea that some principle of
difference in the nature of the ultimate existence
must be postulated in order to account
for empirical diversity, underwent further modifications;
until in the Ḥurūfī sect (an offshoot
of the Ismā‘īlia), in the fourteenth century, it
touched contemporary Ṣūfīism on the one hand,
and Christian Trinity on the other. The "Be",
maintained the Ḥurūfīs, is the eternal word of
God, which, itself uncreated, leads to further
creation—the word externalised. "But for
the 'word' the recognition of the essence of
Divinity would have been impossible; since
Divinity is beyond the reach of sense—perception"<a id="FNanchor_64:1_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_64:1_48" class="fnanchor">[64:1]</a>.
The 'word', therefore, became
flesh in the womb of Mary<a id="FNanchor_64:2_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_64:2_49" class="fnanchor">[64:2]</a> in order to manifest
the Father. The whole Universe is the manifestation
of God's 'word', in which He is
immanent<a id="FNanchor_64:3_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_64:3_50" class="fnanchor">[64:3]</a>. Every sound in the Universe is
within God; every atom is singing the song
of eternity<a id="FNanchor_64:4_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_64:4_51" class="fnanchor">[64:4]</a>; all is life. Those who want to
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_65"></a><a href="images/65.png" class="pgno">[Pg 65]</a></span>
discover the ultimate reality of things, let them
seek "the named" through the Name<a id="FNanchor_65:1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:1_52" class="fnanchor">[65:1]</a>, which
at once conceals and reveals its subject.</p>

<h4>§ III.<br /><br />
<a id="Reaction_against_Rationalism"></a>Reaction against Rationalism.</h4>

<h5>The <ins class="mycorr" title="As̱ẖ‘arīte">A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite</ins>.</h5>

<p>Patronised by the early Caliphs of the House
of ‘Abbās, Rationalism continued to flourish
in the intellectual centres of the Islamic world;
until, in the first half of the 9th century, it
met the powerful orthodox reaction which
found a very energetic leader in Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī
(b, 873 A.D.) who studied under Rationalist
teachers only to demolish, by their own methods,
the edifice they had so laboriously built. He was
a pupil of Al-Jubbā’ī<a id="FNanchor_65:2_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:2_53" class="fnanchor">[65:2]</a>—the representative of
the younger school of Mu‘tazilaism in Baṣra—with
whom he had many controversies<a id="FNanchor_65:3_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:3_54" class="fnanchor">[65:3]</a> which
eventually terminated their friendly relations,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_66"></a><a href="images/66.png" class="pgno">[Pg 66]</a></span>
and led the pupil to bid farewell to the
Mu‘tazila camp. "The fact", says Spitta, "that
Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī was so thoroughly a child of his
time with the successive currents of which he
let himself go, makes him, in another relation, an
important figure to us. In him, as in any other,
are clearly reflected the various tendencies of
this politically as well as religiously interesting
period; and we seldom find ourselves in a
position to weigh the power of the orthodox
confession and the Mu‘tazilite speculation, the
child-like helpless manner of the one, the
immaturity and imperfection of the other, so
completely as in the life of this man who was
orthodox as a boy and a Mu‘tazila as a young
man"<a id="FNanchor_66:1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_66:1_55" class="fnanchor">[66:1]</a>. The Mu‘tazila speculation (e.g. Al-Jāḥiz)
tended to be absolutely unfettered, and in some
cases led to a merely negative attitude of thought.
The movement initiated by Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī was an
attempt not only to purge Islām of all non-Islamic
elements which had quietly crept into
it, but also to harmonize the religious consciousness
with the religious thought of Islam.
Rationalism was an attempt to measure reality
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_67"></a><a href="images/67.png" class="pgno">[Pg 67]</a></span>
by reason alone; it implied the identity of the
spheres of religion and philosophy, and strove
to express faith in the form of concepts or terms
of pure thought. It ignored the facts of human
nature, and tended to disintegrate the solidarity
of the Islamic Church. Hence the reaction.</p>

<p>The orthodox reaction led by the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite
then was, in reality, nothing more than the
transfer of dialectic method to the defence
of the authority of Divine Revelation. In
opposition to the Rationalists, they maintained
the doctrine of the Attributes of God; and,
as regards the Free Will controversy, they
adopted a course lying midway between the
extreme fatalism of the old school, and the
extreme libertarianism of the Rationalists. They
teach that the power of choice as well as all
human actions are created by God; and that
man has been given the power of acquiring<a id="FNanchor_67:1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_67:1_56" class="fnanchor">[67:1]</a>
the different modes of activity. But Fa<span class="u">kh</span>ral-Dīn
Rāzī, who in his violent attack on philosophy
was strenuously opposed by Tūsī and Qutbal-Dīn,
does away with the idea of "acquisition",
and openly maintains the doctrine of necessity
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_68"></a><a href="images/68.png" class="pgno">[Pg 68]</a></span>
in his commentary on the Qur’ān. The Mātarīdiyya—another
school of anti-rationalist
theology, founded by Abu Manṣūr Mātarīdī a
native of Mātarīd in the environs of Samarqand—went
back to the old rationalist position,
and taught in opposition to the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite,
that man has absolute control over his activity;
and that his power affects the very nature of
his actions. Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī's interest was purely
theological; but it was impossible to harmonise
reason and revelation without making reference
to the ultimate nature of reality. Bāqilānī<a id="FNanchor_68:1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_68:1_57" class="fnanchor">[68:1]</a>
therefore, made use of some purely metaphysical
propositions (that substance is an individual
unity; that quality cannot exist in quality;
that perfect vacuum is possible.) in his Theological
investigation, and thus gave the school
a metaphysical foundation which it is our main
object to bring out. We shall not, therefore,
dwell upon their defence of orthodox beliefs
(e.g. that the Qur’ān is uncreated; that the
visibility of God is possible etc.); but we shall
endeavour to pick up the elements of metaphysical
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_69"></a><a href="images/69.png" class="pgno">[Pg 69]</a></span>
thought in their theological controversies.
In order to meet contemporary philosophers
on their own ground, they could not
dispense with <ins class="mycorr" title="plilosophising">philosophising</ins>; hence willingly
or unwillingly they had to develop a theory
of knowledge peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>God, according to the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite, is the
ultimate necessary existence which "carries its
attributes in its own being"<a id="FNanchor_69:1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_69:1_58" class="fnanchor">[69:1]</a>; and whose
existence (wujūd) and essence (Māhiyyat) are
identical. Besides the argument from the
contingent character of motion they used the
following arguments to prove the existence
of this ultimate principle:—</p>

<p>(1). All bodies, they argue, are one in so
far as the phenomenal fact of their existence
is concerned. But in spite of this unity, their
qualities are different and even opposed to
each other. We are, therefore, driven to
postulate an ultimate cause in order to account
for their empirical divergence.</p>

<p>(2). Every contingent being needs a cause
to account for its existence. The Universe is
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_70"></a><a href="images/70.png" class="pgno">[Pg 70]</a></span>
contingent; therefore it must have a cause; and
that cause is God. That the Universe is
contingent, they proved in the following manner.
All that exists in the Universe, is either substance
or quality. The contingence of quality
is evident, and the contingence of substance
follows from the fact that no substance could
exist apart from qualities. The contingence of
quality necessitates the contingence of substance;
otherwise the eternity of substance would necessitate
the eternity of quality. In order fully to
appreciate the value of this argument, it is
necessary to understand the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite theory
of knowledge. To answer the question, "What
is a thing?" they subjected to a searching
criticism the Aristotelian categories of thought,
and arrived at the conclusion that bodies have
no properties in themselves<a id="FNanchor_70:1_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_70:1_59" class="fnanchor">[70:1]</a>. They made no
distinction of secondary and primary qualities
of a body, and reduced all of them to purely
subjective relations. Quality too became with
them a mere accident without which the substance
could not exist. They used the word
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_71"></a><a href="images/71.png" class="pgno">[Pg 71]</a></span>
substance or atom with a vague implication
of externality; but their criticism, actuated by
a pious desire to defend the idea of divine
creation, reduced the Universe to a mere
show of ordered subjectivities which, as they
maintained like Berkeley, found their ultimate
explanation in the Will of God. In his examination
of human knowledge regarded as a
product and not merely a process, Kant stopped
at the idea of "Ding an sich", but the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite
endeavoured to penetrate further, and maintained,
against the contemporary Agnostic-Realism,
that the so called underlying essence
existed only in so far as it was brought in
relation to the knowing subject. Their atomism,
therefore, approaches that of Lotze<a id="FNanchor_71:1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:1_60" class="fnanchor">[71:1]</a> who, in
spite of his desire to save external reality,
ended in its complete reduction to ideality.
But like Lotze they could not believe their
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_72"></a><a href="images/72.png" class="pgno">[Pg 72]</a></span>
atoms to be the inner working of the Infinite
Primal Being. The interest of pure monotheism
was too strong for them. The necessary consequence
of their analysis of matter is a thorough
going idealism like that of Berkeley; but perhaps
their instinctive realism combined with the force
of atomistic tradition, still compels them to
use the word "atom" by which they endeavour
to give something like a realistic coloring to
their idealism. The interest of dogmatic theology
drove them to maintain towards pure Philosophy
an attitude of criticism which taught
her unwilling advocates how to philosophise
and build a metaphysics of their own.</p>

<p>But a more important and philosophically
more significant aspect of the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite Metaphysics,
is their attitude towards the Law of
Causation<a id="FNanchor_72:1_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:1_61" class="fnanchor">[72:1]</a>. Just as they repudiated all the
principles of optics<a id="FNanchor_72:2_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:2_62" class="fnanchor">[72:2]</a> in order to show, in
opposition to the Rationalists, that God could
be visible in spite of His being unextended,
so with a view to defend the possibility of
miracles, they rejected the idea of causation
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_73"></a><a href="images/73.png" class="pgno">[Pg 73]</a></span>
altogether. The orthodox believed in miracles
as well as in the Universal Law of Causation;
but they maintained that, at the time of manifesting
a miracle, God suspended the operation
of this law. The A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite, however, starting
with the supposition that cause and effect must
be similar, could not share the orthodox view,
and taught that the idea of power is meaningless,
and that we know nothing but floating impressions,
the phenomenal order of which is determined
by God.</p>

<p>Any account of the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite metaphysics
would be incomplete without a notice of the
work of Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī (d. 1111 A.D.) who though
misunderstood by many orthodox theologians,
will always be looked upon as one of the
greatest personalities of Islam. This sceptic
of powerful ability anticipated Descartes<a id="FNanchor_73:1_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:1_63" class="fnanchor">[73:1]</a> in
his philosophical method; and, "seven hundred
years before Hume cut the bond of causality
with the edge of his dialectic"<a id="FNanchor_73:2_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_73:2_64" class="fnanchor">[73:2]</a><ins class="edcorr" title=", he">. He</ins> was the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_74"></a><a href="images/74.png" class="pgno">[Pg 74]</a></span>
first to write a systematic refutation of
philosophy, and completely to annihilate
that dread of intellectualism which had
characterised the orthodox. It was chiefly his
influence that made men study dogma and
metaphysics together, and eventually led to a
system of education which produced such men
as <ins class="mycorr" title="Sẖahrastānī"><span class="u">Sh</span>ahrastānī</ins>, Al-Rāzī and Al-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī. The
following passage indicates his attitude as a
thinker:—</p>

<p>"From my childhood I was inclined to think
out things for myself. The result of this attitude
was that I revolted against authority; and all
the beliefs that had fixed themselves in my
mind from childhood lost their original importance.
I thought that such beliefs based on
mere authority were equally entertained by
Jews, Christians, and followers of other religions.
Real knowledge must eradicate all doubt.
For instance, it is self-evident that ten is greater
than three. If a person, however, endeavours
to prove the contrary by an appeal to his
power of turning a stick into a snake, the
performance would indeed be wonderful, though
it cannot touch the certainty of the proposition
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_75"></a><a href="images/75.png" class="pgno">[Pg 75]</a></span>
in question"<a id="FNanchor_75:1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_75:1_65" class="fnanchor">[75:1]</a>. He examined afterwards, all the
various claimants of "Certain Knowledge"
and finally found it in Ṣūfīism.</p>

<p>With their view of the nature of substance,
the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite, rigid monotheists as they were,
could not safely discuss the nature of the
human soul. Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī alone seriously took
up the problem, and to this day it is difficult
to define, with accuracy, his view of the nature
of God. In him, like Borger and Solger in
Germany, Ṣūfī pantheism and the <ins class="mycorr" title="As̱ẖ’arite">A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite</ins>
dogma of personality appear to harmonise
together, a reconciliation which makes it
difficult to say whether he was a Pantheist,
or a Personal Pantheist of the type of Lotze.
The soul, according to Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī, perceives
things. But perception as an attribute can
exist only in a substance or essence which is
absolutely free from all the attributes of body.
In his Al-Madnūn<a id="FNanchor_75:2_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_75:2_66" class="fnanchor">[75:2]</a>, he explains why the prophet
declined to reveal the nature of the soul.
There are, he says, two kinds of men; ordinary
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_76"></a><a href="images/76.png" class="pgno">[Pg 76]</a></span>
men and thinkers. The former who look upon
materiality as a condition of existence, cannot
conceive an immaterial substance. The latter
are led, by their logic, to a conception of the
soul which sweeps away all difference between
God and the individual soul. Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī, therefore,
realised the Pantheistic drift of his own
inquiry, and preferred silence as to the ultimate
nature of the soul.</p>

<p>He is generally included among the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite.
But strictly speaking he is not an <ins class="mycorr" title="As̱ẖ‘ārite">A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite</ins>;
though he admitted that the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite mode
of thought was excellent for the masses. "He
held", says <span class="u">Sh</span>iblī (‘Ilmal-Kalām, p. 66.), "that
the secret of faith could not be revealed; for
this reason he encouraged exposition of the
A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite theology, and took good care in
persuading his immediate disciples not to publish
the results of his private reflection". Such an
attitude towards the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite theology, combined
with his constant use of philosophical
language, could not but lead to suspicion.
Ibn Jauzī, Qāḍī ‘Iyāḍ, and other famous theologians
of the orthodox school, publicly denounced
him as one of the "misguided"; and ‘Iyāḍ
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_77"></a><a href="images/77.png" class="pgno">[Pg 77]</a></span>
went even so far as to order the destruction
of all his philosophical and theological writings
that existed in Spain.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, clear that while the dialectic
of Rationalism destroyed the personality of God,
and reduced divinity to a bare indefinable universality,
the antirationalist movement, though it
preserved the dogma of personality, destroyed
the external reality of nature. In spite of
Nazzām's theory of "Atomic objectification"<a id="FNanchor_77:1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_77:1_67" class="fnanchor">[77:1]</a>,
the atom of the Rationalist possesses an
independent objective reality; that of the
A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite is a fleeting moment of Divine Will.
The one saves nature, and tends to do away
with the God of Theology; the other sacrifices
nature to save God as conceived by the orthodox.
The God-intoxicated Ṣūfī who stands aloof from
the Theological controversies of the age, saves
and spiritualises both the aspects of existence,
and looks upon the whole Universe as the
self-revelation of God—a higher notion
which synthesises the opposite extremes of his
predecessors. "Wooden-legged" Rationalism,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_78"></a><a href="images/78.png" class="pgno">[Pg 78]</a></span>
as the Ṣūfī called it, speaks its last word in
the sceptic Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī, whose restless soul,
after long and hopeless wanderings in the
desolate sands of dry intellectualism, found its
final halting place in the still deep of human
emotion. His scepticism is directed more to
substantiate the necessity of a higher source of
knowledge than merely to defend the dogma of
Islamic Theology, and, therefore, marks the
quiet victory of Ṣūfīism over all the rival
speculative tendencies of the time.</p>

<p>Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī's positive contribution to the
Philosophy of his country, however, is found
in his little book—Mi<span class="u">sh</span>kātal-Anwār—where
he starts with the Quranic verse, "God
is the light of heavens and earth", and
instinctively returns to the Iranian idea, which
was soon to find a vigorous expounder in
Al-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī. Light, he teaches in this book,
is the only real existence; and there is
no darkness greater than non-existence. But
the essence of Light is manifestation: "it
is attributed to manifestation which is a
relation"<a id="FNanchor_78:1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:1_68" class="fnanchor">[78:1]</a>. The Universe was created out of
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_79"></a><a href="images/79.png" class="pgno">[Pg 79]</a></span>
darkness on which God sprinkled<a id="FNanchor_79:1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_79:1_69" class="fnanchor">[79:1]</a> his own
light, and made its different parts more or
less visible according as they received more or
less light. As bodies differ from one another
in being dark, obscure, illuminated or illuminating,
so men are differentiated from one another.
There are some who illuminate other human
beings; and, for this reason, the Prophet is
named "The Burning Lamp" in the Qur’ān.</p>

<p>The physical eye sees only the external
manifestation of the Absolute or Real Light.
There is an internal eye in the heart of man
which, unlike the physical eye, sees itself as
other things, an eye which goes beyond the
finite, and pierces the veil of manifestation.
These thoughts are merely germs, which
developed and fructified in Al-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī's "Philosophy
of Illumination"—Ḥikmatal-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāq.</p>

<p>Such is the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite philosophy.</p>

<p>One great theological result of this reaction
was that it checked the growth of freethought
which tended to dissolve the solidarity of the
Church. We are, however, concerned more with
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_80"></a><a href="images/80.png" class="pgno">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the purely intellectual results of the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite
mode of thought, and these are mainly two:—</p>

<p>(1). It led to an independent criticism of
Greek philosophy as we shall see presently.</p>

<p>(2). In the beginning of the 10th century
when the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite had almost completely
demolished the stronghold of Rationalism, we
see a tendency towards what may be called
Persian Positivism. Al-Birūnī<a id="FNanchor_80:1_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:1_70" class="fnanchor">[80:1]</a> (d. 1048) and
Ibn Hai<span class="u">th</span>am<a id="FNanchor_80:2_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_80:2_71" class="fnanchor">[80:2]</a> (d. 1038) who anticipated modern
empirical Psychology in recognising what is called
reaction-time, gave up all inquiry concerning the
nature of the supersensual, and maintained a
prudent silence about religious matters. Such a
state of things could have existed, but could not
have been logically justified before Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a id="Footnote_47:2_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47:2_29"><span class="label">[47:2]</span></a> The Mu‘tazilas belonged to various nationalities, and many
of them were Persians either by descent or domicile. Wāṣil Ibn
‘Atā—the reported founder of the sect—was a Persian
(Browne, Lit. His., Vol I, p. 281). Von Kremer, however, traces
their origin to the theological controversies of the Umayyad period.
Mu‘tazilaism was not an essentially Persian movement; but
it is true, as Prof. Browne observes (Lit. His., Vol. I, p. 283)
that <span class="u">Sh</span>i‘ite and Qādarī tenets, indeed, often went together, and
the <span class="u">Sh</span>i‘ite doctrine current in Persia at the present day is in
many respects Mu‘tazilite, while Ḥasan Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī, the great
opponent of the Mu‘tazilite, is by the <span class="u">Sh</span>i‘ites held in horror.
It may also be added that some of the greater representatives of
the Mu‘tazila opinion were <span class="u">Sh</span>i‘as by religion, e.g. Abu ’l-Hu<span class="u">dh</span>ail
(Al-Mu‘tazila, ed. by T. W. Arnold, p. 28). On the other hand
many of the followers of Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘ari were Persians (See extracts
from Ibn ‘Asākir ed. Mehren), so that it does not seem <ins class="mycorr" title="o">to</ins> be quite
justifiable to describe the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite mode of thought as a purely
semitic movement.</p></div>

<h3><a id="CHAP_IV"></a><span>CHAP. IV.</span><br /><br />
<span>CONTROVERSY BETWEEN IDEALISM AND REALISM.</span></h3>

<p>The A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite denial of Aristotle's Prima
Materia, and their views concerning the nature
of space, time and causation, awakened that
irrepressible spirit of controversy which, for
centuries, divided the camp of Muhammedan
thinkers, and eventually exhausted its vigor
in the merely verbal subtleties of schools. The
publication of Najm al-Dīn Al-Kātibī's (a follower
of Aristotle whose disciples were called
Philosophers as distinguished from scholastic
theologians) Ḥikmat al-‘Ain<ins class="mycorr" title="-">—</ins>"Philosophy of
Essence", greatly intensified the intellectual
conflict, and invoked keen criticism from a
host of A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite as well as other idealist
thinkers. I shall consider in order the principal
points on which the two schools differed from
each other.</p>

<h4>A. <i>The Nature of the Essence.</i></h4>

<p>We have seen that the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite theory of
knowledge drove them to hold that individual
essences of various things are quite different
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_82"></a><a href="images/82.png" class="pgno">[Pg 82]</a></span>
from each other, and are determined in each
case by the ultimate cause—God. They denied
the existence of an everchanging primary stuff
common to all things, and maintained against
the Rationalists that existence constitutes the
very being of the essence. To them, therefore,
essence and existence are identical. They argued
that the Judgment, "Man is animal", is possible
only on the ground of a fundamental difference
between the subject and the predicate;
since their identity would make the Judgment
nugatory, and complete difference would make
the predication false. It is, therefore, necessary
to postulate an external cause to determine
the various forms of existence. Their opponents,
however, admit the determination or limitation
of existence, but they maintain that all the
various forms of existence, in so far as their
essence is concerned, are identical—all being
limitations of one Primary substance. The followers
of Aristotle met the difficulty suggested
by the possibility of synthetic predication, by
advocating the possibility of compound essences.
Such a judgment as "Man is animal", they
maintained, is true; because man is an essence
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_83"></a><a href="images/83.png" class="pgno">[Pg 83]</a></span>
composed of two essences, animality and humanity.
This, retorted the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite, cannot stand
criticism. If you say that the essence of man
and animal is the same, you in other words
hold that the essence of the whole is the same
as that of the part. But this proposition is
absurd; since if the essence of the compound
is the same as that of its constituents, the
compound will have to be regarded as one
being having two essences or existences.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the whole controversy
turns on the question whether existence is a
mere idea or something objectively real. When
we say that a certain thing exists, do we
mean that it exists only in relation to us
(A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite position); or that it is an essence
existing quite independently of us (Realist
position)? We shall briefly indicate the arguments
of either side. The Realist argued as
follows:—</p>

<p>(1). The conception of my existence is something
immediate or intuitive. The thought "I
exist" is a "concept", and my body being an
element of this "concept", it follows that my
body is intuitively known as something real.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_84"></a><a href="images/84.png" class="pgno">[Pg 84]</a></span>
If the knowledge of the existent is not immediate,
the fact of its perception would require
a process of thought which, as we know, it
does not. The A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite Al-Rāzī admits that
the concept of existence is immediate; but he
regards the judgment—"The concept
of existence is immediate"—as merely a
matter of acquisition. Muḥammad ibn Mubārak
Bu<span class="u">kh</span>ārī, on the other hand, says that the
whole argument of the realist proceeds on
the assumption that the concept of my existence
is something immediate—a position
which can be controverted.<a id="FNanchor_84:1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:1_72" class="fnanchor">[84:1]</a> If, says he, we
admit that the concept of my existence is
immediate, abstract existence cannot be
regarded as a constitutive element of this conception.
And if the realist maintains that the
perception of a particular object is immediate,
we admit the truth of what he says; but it
would not follow, as he is anxious to establish,
that the so called underlying essence is immediately
known as objectively real. The realist
argument, moreover, demands that the mind
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_85"></a><a href="images/85.png" class="pgno">[Pg 85]</a></span>
ought not to be able to conceive the predication
of qualities to things. We cannot conceive,
"snow is white", because whiteness, being
a part of this immediate judgment, must also
be immediately known without any predication.
Mulla Muḥammad Hā<span class="u">sh</span>im Ḥusainī remarks<a id="FNanchor_85:1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:1_73" class="fnanchor">[85:1]</a>
that this reasoning is erroneous. The mind in
the act of predicating whiteness of snow is
working on a purely ideal existence—the
quality of whiteness—and not on an <ins class="mycorr" title="objectivily">objectively</ins>
real essence of which the qualities are mere
facets or aspects. Ḥusainī, moreover, anticipates
Hamilton, and differs from other realists in
holding that the so-called unknowable essence
of the object is also immediately known. The
object, he says, is immediately perceived as
one.<a id="FNanchor_85:2_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:2_74" class="fnanchor">[85:2]</a> We do not successively perceive the
various aspects of what happens to be the
objects of our perception.</p>

<p>(2) The idealist, says the realist, reduces
all quality to mere subjective relations. His
argument leads him to deny the underlying
essence of things, and to look upon them as
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_86"></a><a href="images/86.png" class="pgno">[Pg 86]</a></span>
entirely heterogeneous collections of qualities,
the essence of which consists merely in the
phenomenal fact of their perception. In spite
of his belief in the complete heterogeneity
of things, he applies the word existence
to all things—a tacit admission that there is
some essence common to all the various forms
of existence. Abu’l-Ḥasan al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī replies that
this application is only a verbal convenience,
and is not meant to indicate the so-called
internal homogeneity of things. But the universal
application of the word existence by the idealist,
must mean, according to the realist, that the
existence of a thing either constitutes its very
essence, or it is something superadded to the
underlying essence of the thing. The first
supposition is a virtual admission as to the
homogeneity of things; since we cannot maintain
that existence peculiar to one thing is
fundamentally different from existence peculiar
to another. The supposition that existence is
something superadded to the essence of a thing
leads to an absurdity; since in this case the
essence will have to be regarded as something
distinct from existence; and the denial of essence
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_87"></a><a href="images/87.png" class="pgno">[Pg 87]</a></span>
(with the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite) would blot out the
distinction between existence and non-existence.
Moreover, what was the essence before existence
was superadded to it? We must not say that
the essence was ready to receive existence
before it actually did receive it; since this
statement would imply that the essence was
non-existence before it received existence.
Likewise the statement that the essence has
the power of receiving the quality of non-existence,
implies the absurdity that it does
already exist. Existence, therefore, must be
regarded as forming a part of the essence.
But if it forms a part of the essence, the latter
will have to be regarded as a compound. If,
on the other hand, existence is external to
the essence, it must be something contingent
because of its dependence on something other
than itself. Now everything contingent must
have a cause. If this cause is the essence itself,
it would follow that the essence existed before
it existed; since the cause must precede the
effect in the fact of existence. If, however, the
cause of existence is something other than the
essence, it follows that the existence of God
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_88"></a><a href="images/88.png" class="pgno">[Pg 88]</a></span>
also must be explained by some cause other
than the essence of God—an absurd conclusion
which turns the necessary into the contingent.<a id="FNanchor_88:1_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_88:1_75" class="fnanchor">[88:1]</a>
This argument of the realist is based on a
complete misunderstanding of the idealist
position. He does not see that the idealist
never regarded the fact of existence as something
superadded to the essence of a thing;
but always held it to be identical with the
essence. The essence, says ibn Mubārak,<a id="FNanchor_88:2_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_88:2_76" class="fnanchor">[88:2]</a> is
the cause of existence without being chronologically
before it. The existence of the essence
constitutes its very being; it is not dependent
for it on something other than itself.</p>

<p>The truth is that both sides are far from
a true theory of knowledge. The agnostic
realist who holds that behind the phenomenal
qualities of a thing, there is an essence operating
as their cause, is guilty of a glaring
contradiction. He holds that underlying the
thing there is an <i>unknowable</i> essence or substratum
which is <i>known</i> to exist. The A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite
idealist, on the other hand, misunderstands
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_89"></a><a href="images/89.png" class="pgno">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the process of knowledge. He ignores the
mental activity involved in the act of knowledge;
and looks upon perceptions as mere
presentations which are determined, as he says,
by God. But if the order of presentations
requires a cause to account for it, why should
not that cause be sought in the original constitution
of matter as Locke did? Moreover,
the theory that knowledge is a mere passive
perception or awareness of what is presented,
leads to certain inadmissible conclusions which
the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite never thought of:—</p>

<p>(a). They did not see that their purely subjective
conception of knowledge swept away all
possibility of error. If the existence of a thing is
merely the fact of its being presented, there
is no reason why it should be cognised as
different from what it actually is.</p>

<p>(b). They did not see that on their theory
of knowledge, our fellow-beings like other
elements of the physical order, would have no
higher reality than mere states of my consciousness.</p>

<p>(c). If knowledge is a mere receptivity of
presentations, God who, as cause of presentations,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_90"></a><a href="images/90.png" class="pgno">[Pg 90]</a></span>
is active in regard to the act of our
knowledge, must not be aware of our presentations.
From the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite point of view this
conclusion is fatal to their whole position. They
cannot say that presentations on their ceasing
to be my presentations, continue to be presentations
to God's consciousness.</p>

<p>Another question connected with the nature
of the essence is, whether it is caused or
uncaused. The followers of Aristotle, or philosophers
as they are generally called by their
opponents, hold that the underlying essence
of things is uncaused. The A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite hold the
opposite view. Essence, says the Aristotelian,
cannot be acted upon by any external agent.<a id="FNanchor_90:1_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:1_77" class="fnanchor">[90:1]</a>
Al-Kātibī argues that if, for instance, the essence
of humanity had resulted from the operation
of an external activity, doubt as to its being
the real essence of humanity would have been
possible. As a matter of fact we never entertain
such a doubt; it follows, therefore, that
the essence is not due to the activity of an
agency external to itself. The idealist starts
with the realist distinction of essence and
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_91"></a><a href="images/91.png" class="pgno">[Pg 91]</a></span>
existence, and argues that the realist line of
argument would lead to the absurd proposition—that
man is uncaused; since he must
be regarded, according to the realist, as a
combination of two uncaused essences—existence
and humanity.</p>

<h4>B. <i>The Nature of Knowledge.</i></h4>

<p>The followers of Aristotle, true to their
position as to the independent objective reality
of the essence, define knowledge as "receiving
images of external things".<a id="FNanchor_91:1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_91:1_78" class="fnanchor">[91:1]</a> It is possible to
conceive, they argue, an object which is externally
unreal, and to which other qualities can
be attributed. But when we attribute to it
the quality of existence, actual existence is
necessitated; since the affirmation of the quality
of a thing is a part of the affirmation of
that thing. If, therefore, the predication of
existence does not necessitate actual objective
existence of the thing, we are driven to deny
externality altogether, and to hold that the
thing exists in the mind as a mere idea. But
the affirmation of a thing, says Ibn Mubārak,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_92"></a><a href="images/92.png" class="pgno">[Pg 92]</a></span>
constitutes the very existence of the thing.
The idealist makes no such distinction as affirmation
and existence. To infer from the above
argument that the thing must be regarded as
existing in the mind, is unjustifiable. "Ideal"
existence follows only from the denial of externality
which the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite do not deny; since
they hold that knowledge is a relation between
the knower and the known which is known
as external. Al-Kātibī's proposition that if the
thing does not exist as external existence, it
must exist as ideal or mental existence, is self-contradictory;
since, on his principles, everything
that exists in idea exists in externality.<a id="FNanchor_92:1_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:1_79" class="fnanchor">[92:1]</a></p>

<h4>C. <i>The Nature of Non-existence.</i></h4>

<p>Al-Kātibī explains and criticises the proposition,
maintained by contemporary philosophers
generally—"That the existent is
good, and the non-existent is evil".<a id="FNanchor_92:2_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:2_80" class="fnanchor">[92:2]</a> The fact
of murder, he says, is not evil because the
murderer had the power of committing such
a thing; or because the instrument of murder
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_93"></a><a href="images/93.png" class="pgno">[Pg 93]</a></span>
had the power of cutting; or because the neck
of the murdered had the capacity of being
cut asunder. It is evil because it signifies the
negation of life—a condition which is non-existential,
and not existential like the conditions
indicated above. But in order to show
that evil is non-existence, we should make an
inductive inquiry, and examine all the various
cases of evil. A perfect induction, however, is
impossible, and an incomplete induction cannot
prove the point. Al-Kātibī, therefore, rejects
this proposition, and holds that "non-existence
is absolute nothing".<a id="FNanchor_93:1_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_93:1_81" class="fnanchor">[93:1]</a> The possible '<i>essences</i>',
according to him, are not lying fixed in space
waiting for the attribute of existence; otherwise
fixity in space would have to be regarded
as possessing no existence. But his critics
hold that this argument is true only on the
supposition that fixity in space and existence
are identical. Fixity in externality, says Ibn
Mubārak, is a conception wider than existence.
All existence is external, but all that is external
is not necessarily existent.</p>

<p>The interest of the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite in the dogma
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_94"></a><a href="images/94.png" class="pgno">[Pg 94]</a></span>
of the Resurrection—the possibility of the reappearance
of the non-existent as existent—led
them to advocate the apparently absurd proposition
that "non-existence or nothing <i>is</i> something".
They argued that, since we make
judgments about the non-existent, it is, therefore,
known; and the fact of its knowability
indicates that "the nothing" is not absolutely
nothing. The knowable is a case of affirmation
and the non-existent being knowable, is a case
of affirmation.<a id="FNanchor_94:1_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_94:1_82" class="fnanchor">[94:1]</a> Al-Kātibī denies the truth of
the Major. Impossible things, he says, are
known, yet they do not externally exist. Al-Rāzī
criticises this argument accusing Al-Kātibī
of the ignorance of the fact that the '<i>essence</i>'
exists in the mind, and yet is known as external.
Al-Kātibī supposes that the knowledge of a
thing necessitates its existence as an independent
objective reality. Moreover it should
be remembered that the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite discriminate
between positive and existent on the one hand,
and non-existent and negative on the other.
They say that all existent is positive, but the
converse of this proposition is not true. There
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_95"></a><a href="images/95.png" class="pgno">[Pg 95]</a></span>
is certainly a relation between the existent
and the non-existent, but there is absolutely no
relation between the positive and the negative.
We do not say, as Al-Kātibī holds, that the
impossible is non-existent; we say that the
impossible is only negative. Substances which
do exist are something positive. As regards
the attribute which cannot be conceived as
existing apart from the substance, it is neither
existent nor non-existent, but something between
the two. Briefly the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite position is as
follows:—</p>

<p>"A thing has a proof of its existence or
not. If not, it is called negative. If it has a
proof of its existence, it is either substance
or attribute. If it is substance and has the
attribute of existence or non-existence, (i.e. it
is perceived or not) it is existent or non-existent
accordingly. If it is attribute, it is neither
existent nor non-existent".<a id="FNanchor_95:1_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_95:1_83" class="fnanchor">[95:1]</a></p>

<h3><a id="CHAP_V"></a><span>CHAP. V.</span><br /><br />
<span>ṢŪFĪISM.</span></h3>

<h4>§ I.<br /><br />
<a id="The_origin_and_Quranic_Justification"></a>The origin and Qurānic Justification
of Ṣūfīism.</h4>

<p>It has become quite a fashion with modern
oriental scholarship to trace the chain of
influences. Such a procedure has certainly great
historical value, provided it does not make us
ignore the fundamental fact, that the human
mind possesses an independent individuality,
and, acting on its own initiative, can gradually
evolve out of itself, truths which may have
been anticipated by other minds ages ago.
No idea can seize a people's soul unless, in
some sense, it is the people's own. External
influences may wake it up from its deep
unconscious slumber; but they cannot, so to
speak, create it out of nothing.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the origin of
Persian Ṣūfīism; and, in almost all cases,
explorers of this most interesting field of
research have exercised their ingenuity in discovering
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_97"></a><a href="images/97.png" class="pgno">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the various channels through which
the basic ideas of Ṣūfīism might have travelled
from one place to another. They seem completely
to have ignored the principle, that the
full significance of a phenomenon in the intellectual
evolution of a people, can only be
comprehended in the light of those pre-existing
intellectual, political, and social conditions which
alone make its existence inevitable. Von Kremer
and Dozy derive Persian Ṣūfīism from the Indian
Vedanta; Merx and Mr. Nicholson derive it
from Neo-Platonism; while Professor Browne
once regarded it as Aryan reaction against
an unemotional semitic religion. It appears to
me, however, that these theories have been
worked out under the influence of a notion of
causation which is essentially false. That a
fixed quantity A is the cause of, or produces
another fixed quantity B, is a proposition which,
though convenient for scientific purposes, is apt
to damage all inquiry, in so far as it leads
us completely to ignore the innumerable conditions
lying at the back of a phenomenon. It
would, for instance, be an historical error to
say that the dissolution of the Roman Empire
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_98"></a><a href="images/98.png" class="pgno">[Pg 98]</a></span>
was due to the barbarian invasions. The
statement completely ignores other forces of a
different character that tended to split up the
political unity of the Empire. To describe the
advent of barbarian invasions as the cause of
the dissolution of the Roman Empire which
could have assimilated, as it actually did to
a certain extent, the so-called cause, is a
procedure that no logic would justify. Let us,
therefore, in the light of a truer theory of
causation, enumerate the principal political,
social, and intellectual conditions of Islamic
life about the end of the 8<sup>th</sup> and the first half
of the 9<sup>th</sup> century when, properly speaking,
the Ṣūfī ideal of life came into existence, to
be soon followed by a philosophical justification
of that ideal.—</p>

<p>(1). When we study the history of the time,
we find it to be a time of more or less political
unrest. The latter half of the 8<sup>th</sup> century presents,
besides the political revolution which resulted
in the overthrow of the Umayyads (749 A.D.),
persecutions of Zendīks, and revolts of Persian
heretics (Sindbāh 755–6; Ustādhīs 766–8;
the veiled prophet of <span class="u">Kh</span>urāsān 777–80) who,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_99"></a><a href="images/99.png" class="pgno">[Pg 99]</a></span>
working on the credulity of the people, cloaked,
like Lamennais in our own times, political
projects under the guise of religious ideas.
Later on in the beginning of the 9<sup>th</sup> century
we find the sons of Hārūn (Ma’mūn and Amīn)
engaged in a terrible conflict for political
supremacy; and still later, we see the Golden
Age of Islamic literature seriously disturbed
by the persistent revolt of the Mazdakite Bābak
(816:838). The early years of Ma’mun's reign
present another social phenomenon of great
political significance—the <span class="u">Sh</span>u‘ūbiyya controversy
(815), which progresses with the rise
and establishment of independent Persian
families, the Tāhirīd (820), the Ṣaffārīd
(868), and the Sāmānīd Dynasty (874). It is,
therefore, the combined force of these and
other conditions of a similar nature that contributed
to drive away spirits of devotional
character from the scene of continual unrest
to the blissful peace of an ever-deepening
contemplative life. The semitic character of
the life and thought of these early Muhammadan
ascetics is gradually followed by a large hearted
pantheism of a more or less Aryan stamp, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_100"></a><a href="images/100.png" class="pgno">[Pg 100]</a></span>
development of which, in fact, runs parallel
to the slowly progressing political independence
of Persia.</p>

<p>(2). <i>The Sceptical tendencies of Islamic
Rationalism</i> which found an early expression
in the poems of Ba<span class="u">sh</span><span class="u">sh</span>ār ibn Burd—the blind
Persian Sceptic who deified fire, and scoffed
at all non-Persian modes of thought. The germs
of Scepticism latent in Rationalism ultimately
necessitated an appeal to a super-intellectual
source of knowledge which asserted itself in
the Risāla of Al-Qu<span class="u">sh</span>airī (986). In our own
times the negative results of Kant's Critique
of Pure Reason drove Jacobi and Schleiermacher
to base faith on the feeling of the reality of
the ideal; and to the 19<sup>th</sup> century sceptic
Wordsworth uncovered that mysterious state
of mind "in which we grow all spirit and see
into the life of things".</p>

<p>(3). The unemotional piety of the various
schools of Islam—the Ḥanafite (Abu Ḥanīfa
d. 767), the <span class="u">Sh</span>āfiite (Al-<span class="u">Sh</span>āfi‘ī d. 820), the
Mālikite (Al-Mālik d. 795), and the anthropomorphic
Ḥambalite (Ibn Ḥambal d. 855)—the
bitterest enemy of independent thought—which
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_101"></a><a href="images/101.png" class="pgno">[Pg 101]</a></span>
ruled the masses after the death of Al-Ma’mūn.</p>

<p>(4). The religious discussions among the
representatives of various creeds encouraged
by Al-Ma’mūn, and especially the bitter theological
controversy between the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arites, and
the advocates of Rationalism which tended not
only to confine religion within the narrow limits
of schools, but also stirred up the spirit to
rise above all petty sectarian wrangling.</p>

<p>(5). The gradual softening of religious fervency
due to the rationalistic tendency of the
early ‘Abbāsid period, and the rapid growth
of wealth which tended to produce moral laxity
and indifference to religious life in the upper
circles of Islam.</p>

<p>(6). The presence of Christianity as a working
ideal of life. It was, however, principally the
actual life of the Christian hermit rather than
his religious ideas, that exercised the greatest
fascination over the minds of early Islamic
Saints whose complete unworldliness, though
extremely charming in itself, is, I believe, quite
contrary to the spirit of Islam.</p>

<p>Such was principally the environment of
Ṣūfīism, and it is to the combined action of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_102"></a><a href="images/102.png" class="pgno">[Pg 102]</a></span>
above <ins class="edcorr" title="condition">conditions</ins> that we should look for the
origin and development of Ṣūfīistic ideas. Given
these conditions and the Persian mind with an
almost innate tendency towards monism, the
whole phenomenon of the birth and growth of
Ṣūfīism is explained. If we now study the principal
pre-existing conditions of Neo-Platonism, we
find that similar conditions produced similar
results. The barbarian raids which were soon
to reduce Emperors of the Palace to Emperors
of the Camp, assumed a more serious aspect
about the middle of the third century. Plotinus
himself speaks of the political unrest of his
time in one of his letters to Flaccus.<a id="FNanchor_102:1_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_102:1_84" class="fnanchor">[102:1]</a> When
he looked round himself in Alexandria, his
birth place, he noticed signs of growing
toleration and indifferentism towards religious
life. Later on in Rome which had become, so
to say, a pantheon of different nations, he
found a similar want of seriousness in life, a
similar laxity of character in the upper classes
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_103"></a><a href="images/103.png" class="pgno">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of society. In more learned circles philosophy
was studied as a branch of literature rather
than for its own sake; and Sextus Empiricus,
provoked by Antiochus's tendency to fuse
scepticism and Stoicism was teaching the old
unmixed scepticism of Pyrrho—that intellectual
despair which drove Plotinus to find truth
in a revelation above thought itself. Above
all, the hard unsentimental character of Stoic
morality, and the loving piety of the followers
of Christ who, undaunted by long and fierce
persecutions, were preaching the message of
peace and love to the whole Roman world,
necessitated a restatement of Pagan thought
in a way that might revivify the older ideals
of life, and suit the new spiritual requirements
of the people. But the ethical force of Christianity
was too great for Neo-Platonism which,
on account of its more metaphysical<a id="FNanchor_103:1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_103:1_85" class="fnanchor">[103:1]</a> character,
had no message for the people at large, and was
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_104"></a><a href="images/104.png" class="pgno">[Pg 104]</a></span>
consequently inaccessible to the rude barbarian
who, being influenced by the actual life of the
persecuted Christian adopted Christianity, and
settled down to construct new empires
out of the ruins of the old. In Persia the
influence of culture-contacts and cross-fertilisation
of ideas created in certain minds a vague
desire to realise a similar restatement of Islam,
which gradually assimilated Christian ideals as
well as Christian Gnostic speculation, and found
a firm foundation in the Qur’ān. The flower of
Greek Thought faded away before the breath
of Christianity; but the burning simoon of
Ibn Taimiyya's invective could not touch the
freshness of the Persian rose. The one was
completely swept away by the flood of barbarian
invasions; the other, unaffected by the Tartar
revolution, still holds its own.</p>

<p>This extraordinary vitality of the Ṣūfī <ins class="mycorr" title="restatemet">restatement</ins>
of Islam, however, is explained when
we reflect on the all-embracing structure of
Ṣūfīism. The semitic formula of salvation can
be briefly stated in the words, "Transform your
will",—which signifies that the Semite looks
upon will as the essence of the human soul.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_105"></a><a href="images/105.png" class="pgno">[Pg 105]</a></span>
The Indian Vedantist, on the other hand,
teaches that all pain is due to our mistaken
attitude towards the Universe. He, therefore,
commands us to transform our understanding—implying
thereby that the essential nature of
man consists in thought, not activity or will. But
the Ṣūfī holds that the mere transformation of
will or understanding will not bring peace;
we should bring about the transformation of
both by a complete transformation of feeling,
of which will and understanding are only
specialised forms. His message to the individual
is—"Love all, and forget your own individuality
in doing good to others." Says Rūmī:—"To
win other people's hearts is the greatest
pilgrimage; and one heart is worth more than
a thousand <ins class="mycorr" title="Ka‘bāhs">Ka‘bahs</ins>. Ka‘bah is a mere cottage
of Abraham; but the heart is the very home
of God." But this formula demands a <i>why</i>
and a <i>how</i>—a metaphysical justification of the
ideal in order to satisfy the understanding;
and rules of action in order to guide the will.
Ṣūfīism furnishes both. Semitic religion is a
code of strict rules of conduct; the Indian
Vedanta, on the other hand, is a cold system
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_106"></a><a href="images/106.png" class="pgno">[Pg 106]</a></span>
of thought. Ṣūfīism avoids their incomplete
Psychology, and attempts to synthesise both
the Semitic and the Aryan formulas in the
higher category of Love. On the one hand
it assimilates the Buddhistic idea of Nirwāna
(Fanā-Annihilation), and seeks to build a
metaphysical system in the light of this idea;
on the other hand it does not disconnect itself
from Islam, and finds the justification of its
view of the Universe in the Qur’ān. Like the
geographical position of its home, it stands
midway between the Semitic and the Aryan,
assimilating ideas from both sides, and giving
them the stamp of its own individuality which,
on the whole, is more Aryan than Semitic in
character. It would, therefore, be evident that
the secret of the vitality of Ṣūfīism is the
complete view of human nature upon which
it is based. It has survived orthodox persecutions
and political revolutions, because it appeals
to human nature in its entirety; and, while
it concentrates its interest chiefly in a <i>life</i> of
self-denial, it allows free play to the speculative
tendency as well.</p>

<p>I will now briefly indicate how Ṣūfī writers
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_107"></a><a href="images/107.png" class="pgno">[Pg 107]</a></span>
justify their views from the Quranic standpoint.
There is no historical evidence to show that
the Prophet of Arabia actually communicated
certain esoteric doctrines to ‘Alī or Abū Bakr.
The Ṣūfī, however, contends that the Prophet
had an esoteric teaching—"wisdom"—as
distinguished from the teaching contained in
the Book, and he brings forward the following
verse to substantiate his case:—"As we have
sent a prophet to you from among yourselves
who reads our verses to you, purifies you,
teaches you the Book and the <i>Wisdom</i>, and
teaches you <i>what you did not know before</i>."<a id="FNanchor_107:1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_107:1_86" class="fnanchor">[107:1]</a>
He holds that "the wisdom" spoken of in the
verse, is something not incorporated in the
teaching of the Book which, as the Prophet
repeatedly declared, had been taught by several
prophets before him. If, he says, the wisdom
is included in the Book, the word "Wisdom"
in the verse would be redundant. It can, I
think, be easily shown that in the Qur’ān as
well as in the authenticated traditions, there
are germs of Ṣūfī doctrine which, owing to the
thoroughly practical genius of the Arabs, could
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_108"></a><a href="images/108.png" class="pgno">[Pg 108]</a></span>
not develop and fructify in Arabia, but which
grew up into a distinct doctrine when they
found favourable circumstances in alien soils.
The Qur’ān thus defines the Muslims:—"Those
who believe in the Unseen, establish daily
prayer, and spend out of what We have given
them."<a id="FNanchor_108:1_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:1_87" class="fnanchor">[108:1]</a> But the question arises as to the
<i>what</i> and the <i>where</i> of the Unseen. The
Qur’ān replies that the Unseen is in your own
soul—"And in the earth there are signs to
those who believe, and in yourself,—what!
do you not then see!"<a id="FNanchor_108:2_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:2_88" class="fnanchor">[108:2]</a> And again—"We
are nigher to him (man) than his own jugular
vein."<a id="FNanchor_108:3_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:3_89" class="fnanchor">[108:3]</a> Similarly the Holy Book teaches that
the essential nature of the Unseen is pure
light—"God is the light of heavens and
earth."<a id="FNanchor_108:4_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:4_90" class="fnanchor">[108:4]</a> As regards the question whether this
Primal Light is personal, the Qur’ān, in spite
of many expressions signifying personality,
declares in a few words—"There is nothing
like him."<a id="FNanchor_108:5_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_108:5_91" class="fnanchor">[108:5]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_109"></a><a href="images/109.png" class="pgno">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>
<p>These are some of the chief verses out of
which the various Ṣūfī commentators develop
pantheistic views of the Universe. They enumerate
the following four stages of spiritual
training through which the soul—the order
or reason of the Primal Light—("Say that
the soul is the order or reason of God.")<a id="FNanchor_109:1_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_109:1_92" class="fnanchor">[109:1]</a>
has to pass, if it desires to rise above the
common herd, and realise its union or identity
with the ultimate source of all things:—</p>

<p>(1). Belief in the Unseen.</p>

<p>(2). Search after the Unseen. The spirit of
inquiry leaves its slumber by observing the
marvellous phenomena of nature. "Look at
the camel how it is created; the skies how
they are exalted; the mountains how they are
unshakeably fixed."<a id="FNanchor_109:2_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_109:2_93" class="fnanchor">[109:2]</a></p>

<p>(3). The knowledge of the Unseen. This
comes, as we have indicated above, by looking
into the depths of our own soul.</p>

<p>(4). The Realisation—This results, according
to the higher Ṣūfīism from the constant practice
of Justice and Charity—"Verily God bids you
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_110"></a><a href="images/110.png" class="pgno">[Pg 110]</a></span>
do justice and good, and give to kindred (their
due), and He forbids you to sin, and do wrong,
and oppress".<a id="FNanchor_110:1_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_110:1_94" class="fnanchor">[110:1]</a></p>

<p>It must, however, be remembered that some
later Ṣūfī fraternities (e.g. Naq<span class="u">sh</span>bandī) devised,
or rather borrowed<a id="FNanchor_110:2_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_110:2_95" class="fnanchor">[110:2]</a> from the Indian Vedantist,
other means of bringing about this Realisation.
They taught, imitating the Hindu doctrine of
Kundalīnī, that there are six great centres of
light of various colours in the body of man. It
is the object of the Ṣūfī to make them move,
or to use the technical word, "current" by
certain methods of meditation, and eventually
to realise, amidst the apparent diversity of
colours, the fundamental colourless light which
makes everything visible, and is itself invisible.
The continual movement of these centres of
light through the body, and the final realisation
of their identity, which results from putting the
atoms of the body into definite courses of motion
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_111"></a><a href="images/111.png" class="pgno">[Pg 111]</a></span>
by slow repetition of the various names of God
and other mysterious expressions, illuminates
the whole body of the Ṣūfī; and the perception
of the same illumination in the external world
completely extinguishes the sense of "otherness."
The fact that these methods were known to
the Persian Ṣūfīs misled Von Kremer who
ascribed the whole phenomenon of Ṣūfīism to
the influence of Vedantic ideas. Such methods
of contemplation are quite unislamic in character,
and the higher Ṣūfīs do not attach any importance
to them.</p>

<h4>§ II.<br /><br />
<a id="Aspects_of_Sufi-Metaphysics"></a>Aspects of Ṣūfī-Metaphysics.</h4>

<p>Let us now return to the various schools or
rather the various aspects of Ṣūfī Metaphysics.
A careful investigation of Ṣūfī literature shows
that Ṣūfīism has looked at the Ultimate Reality
from three standpoints which, in fact, do not
exclude but complement each other. Some
Ṣūfīs conceive the essential nature of reality
as <ins class="mycorr" title="self-consious">self-conscious</ins> will, others beauty; others again
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_112"></a><a href="images/112.png" class="pgno">[Pg 112]</a></span>
hold that Reality is essentially Thought, Light
or Knowledge. There are, therefore, three
aspects of Ṣūfī thought:—</p>

<h5><a id="Reality_as_Self-conscious_Will"></a>A. <i>Reality as Self-conscious Will.</i></h5>

<p>The first in historical order is that represented
by <span class="u">Sh</span>aqīq Bal<span class="u">kh</span>ī, Ibrāhim Adham, Rābi‘a, and
others. This school conceives the ultimate
reality as "Will", and the Universe a finite
activity of that will. It is essentially monotheistic
and consequently more semitic in character.
It is not the desire of Knowledge which
dominates the ideal of the Ṣūfīs of this school,
but the characteristic features of their life are
piety, unworldliness, and an intense longing
for God due to the consciousness of sin.
Their object is not to philosophise, but principally
to work out a certain ideal of life. From
our standpoint, therefore, they are not of much
importance.</p>

<h5><a id="Reality_as_Beauty"></a>B. <i>Reality as Beauty.</i></h5>

<p>In the beginning of the 9<sup>th</sup> century Ma‘rūf
Kar<span class="u">kh</span>ī defined Ṣūfīism as "Apprehension of
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_113"></a><a href="images/113.png" class="pgno">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Divine realities"<a id="FNanchor_113:1_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:1_96" class="fnanchor">[113:1]</a>—a definition which marks
the movement from Faith to Knowledge. But
the method of apprehending the ultimate reality
was formally stated by Al-Qu<span class="u">sh</span>airī about the
end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. The teachers of this
school adopted the Neo-Platonic idea of creation
by intermediary agencies; and though this
idea lingered in the minds of Ṣūfī writers for
a long time, yet their Pantheism led them to
abandon the Emanation theory altogether. Like
Avicenna they looked upon the ultimate Reality
as "Eternal Beauty" whose very nature consists
in seeing its own "face" reflected in the
Universe-mirror. The Universe, therefore,
became to them a reflected image of the
"Eternal Beauty", and not an emanation as
the Neo-Platonists had taught. The cause of
creation, says Mīr Sayyid <span class="u">Sh</span>arīf, is the manifestation
of Beauty, and the first creation is
Love. The realisation of this Beauty, is brought
about by universal love, which the innate
Zoroastrian instinct of the Persian Ṣūfī loved
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_114"></a><a href="images/114.png" class="pgno">[Pg 114]</a></span>
to define as "the Sacred Fire which burns up
everything other than God." Says Rūmī:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O thou pleasant madness, Love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou Physician of all our ills!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou healer of pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou Plato and Galen of our souls!"<a id="FNanchor_114:1_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:1_97" class="fnanchor">[114:1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As a direct consequence of such a view of
the Universe, we have the idea of impersonal
absorption which first appears in Bāyazīd of
Bistām, and which constitutes the characteristic
feature of the later development of this school.
The growth of this idea may have been
influenced by Hindu pilgrims travelling through
Persia to the Buddhistic temple still existing
at Bāku.<a id="FNanchor_114:2_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_114:2_98" class="fnanchor">[114:2]</a> The school became wildly pantheistic
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_115"></a><a href="images/115.png" class="pgno">[Pg 115]</a></span>
in Ḥusain Manṣūr who, in the true spirit of
the Indian Vedantist, cried out, "I am God"—Aham
Brahma asmi.</p>

<p>The ultimate Reality or Eternal Beauty,
according to the Ṣūfīs of this school, is infinite
in the sense that "it is absolutely free from
the limitations of beginning, end, right, left,
above, and below."<a id="FNanchor_115:1_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:1_99" class="fnanchor">[115:1]</a> The distinction of essence
and attribute does not exist in the Infinite—"Substance
and quality are really identical."<a id="FNanchor_115:2_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:2_100" class="fnanchor">[115:2]</a>
We have indicated above that nature is the
mirror of the Absolute Existence. But according
to Nasafī, there are two kinds of mirrors<a id="FNanchor_115:3_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:3_101" class="fnanchor">[115:3]</a>—</p>

<p>(a). That which shows merely a reflected
image—this is external nature.</p>

<p>(b). That which shows the real Essence—this
is man who is a limitation of the Absolute,
and erroneously thinks himself to be an
independent entity.</p>

<p>"O Derwish!" says Nasafī "dost thou think
that thy existence is independent of God? This
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_116"></a><a href="images/116.png" class="pgno">[Pg 116]</a></span>
is a great error."<a id="FNanchor_116:1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:1_102" class="fnanchor">[116:1]</a> Nasafī explains his meaning
by a beautiful parable.<a id="FNanchor_116:2_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:2_103" class="fnanchor">[116:2]</a> The fishes in a certain
tank realised that they lived, moved, and had
their being in water, but felt that they were quite
ignorant of the real nature of what constituted
the very source of their life. They resorted
to a wiser fish in a great river, and the
Philosopher-fish addressed them thus:—</p>

<p>"O you who endeavour to untie the knot
(of being)! You are born in union, yet die in
the thought of an unreal separation. Thirsty on
the sea-shore! Dying penniless while master
of the treasure!"</p>

<p>All feeling of separation, therefore, is
ignorance; and all "otherness" is a mere
appearance, a dream, a shadow—a differentiation
born of relation essential to the
self-recognition of the Absolute. The great
prophet of this school is "The excellent Rūmī"
as Hegel calls him. He took up the old Neo-Platonic
idea of the Universal soul working
through the various spheres of being, and
expressed it in a way so modern in spirit that
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_117"></a><a href="images/117.png" class="pgno">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Clodd introduces the passage in his "Story of
Creation". I venture to quote this famous
passage in order to show how successfully the
poet anticipates the modern concept of evolution,
which he regarded as the realistic side of his
Idealism.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First man appeared in the clan of inorganic things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next he passed therefrom into that of plants.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For years he lived as one of the plants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering nought of his inorganic state so different;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he passed from the vegetive to the animal state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had no remembrance of his state as a plant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except the inclination he felt to the world of plants,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Again the great creator as you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew man out of the animal into the human state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus man passed from one order of nature to another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he became wise and knowing and strong as he is now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his first soul he has now no remembrance,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">(Ma<span class="u">th</span>nawī Book IV).<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It would now be instructive if we compare this
aspect of Ṣūfī thought with the fundamental
ideas of Neo-Platonism. The God of Neo-Platonism
is immanent as well as transcendant.
"As being the cause of all things, it is everywhere.
As being other than all things, it is
nowhere. If it were only "everywhere", and
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_118"></a><a href="images/118.png" class="pgno">[Pg 118]</a></span>
not also "nowhere", it would <i>be</i> all things."<a id="FNanchor_118:1_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_118:1_104" class="fnanchor">[118:1]</a>
The Ṣūfī, however, tersely says that God
<i>is</i> all things. The Neo-Platonist allows a certain
permanence or fixity to matter;<a id="FNanchor_118:2_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_118:2_105" class="fnanchor">[118:2]</a> but the Ṣūfīs
of the school in question, regard all empirical
experience as a kind of dreaming. Life in
limitation, they say, is sleep; death brings the
awakening. It is, however, the doctrine of
Impersonal immortality—"genuinely eastern
in spirit"—which distinguishes this school from
Neo-Platonism. "Its (Arabian Philosophy)
distinctive doctrine", says Whittaker, "of an
Impersonal immortality of the general human
intellect is, however, as contrasted with Aristotelianism
and Neo-Platonism, essentially original."</p>

<p>The above brief exposition shows that
there are three basic ideas of this mode of
thought:—</p>

<p>(a). That the ultimate Reality is knowable
through a supersensual state of consciousness.</p>

<p>(b). That the ultimate Reality is impersonal.</p>

<p>(c). That the ultimate Reality is one.</p>

<p>Corresponding to these ideas we have:
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_119"></a><a href="images/119.png" class="pgno">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>(I). The Agnostic reaction as manifested in
the Poet ‘Umar <span class="u">Kh</span>ayyām (12<sup>th</sup> century) who
cried out in his intellectual despair:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The joyous souls who quaff potations deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saints who in the mosque sad vigils keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are lost at sea alike, and find no shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One only wakes, all others are asleep.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>(II). The monotheistic reaction of Ibn
Taimiyya and his followers in the 13<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>(III). The Pluralistic reaction of Wāḥid
Maḥmūd<a id="FNanchor_119:1_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:1_106" class="fnanchor">[119:1]</a> in the 13<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>Speaking from a purely philosophical standpoint,
the last movement is most interesting.
The history of Thought illustrates the operation
of certain general laws of progress which are
true of the intellectual annals of different
peoples. The German systems of monistic
thought invoked the pluralism of Herbart;
while the pantheism of Spinoza called forth
the monadism of Leibniz. The operation of
the same law led Wāḥid Maḥmūd to deny the
truth of contemporary monism, and declare
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_120"></a><a href="images/120.png" class="pgno">[Pg 120]</a></span>
that Reality is not one but many. Long before
Leibniz he taught that the Universe is a combination
of what he called "Afrād"—essential
units, or simple atoms which have existed from
all eternity, and are endowed with life. The law
of the Universe is an ascending perfection of
elemental matter, continually passing from
lower to higher forms determined by the kind
of food which the fundamental units assimilate.
Each period of his cosmogony comprises 8,000
years, and after eight such periods the world
is decomposed, and the units re-combine to
construct a new universe. Wāḥid Maḥmūd
succeeded in founding a sect which was cruelly
persecuted, and finally stamped out of existence
by <span class="u">Sh</span>āh ‘Abbās. It is said that the poet Ḥāfiz
of <span class="u">Sh</span>īrāz believed in the tenets of this sect.</p>

<h5>C. <i>Reality as Light or Thought.</i></h5>

<p>The third great school of Ṣūfīism conceives
Reality as essentially Light or Thought, the
very nature of which demands something to
be thought or illuminated. While the preceding
school abandoned Neo-Platonism, this school
transformed it into new systems. There are,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_121"></a><a href="images/121.png" class="pgno">[Pg 121]</a></span>
however, two aspects of the metaphysics of
this school. The one is genuinely Persian in
spirit, the other is chiefly influenced by Christian
modes of thought. Both agree in holding that
the fact of empirical diversity necessitates a
principle of difference in the nature of the
ultimate Reality. I now proceed to consider
them in their historical order.</p>

<h5><a id="Reality_as_Light"></a>I. Reality as Light—Al-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī.</h5>

<h5>Return to Persian Dualism.</h5>

<p>The application of Greek dialectic to Islamic
Theology aroused that spirit of critical examination
which began with Al-A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arī, and found
its completest expression in the scepticism of
Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī. Even among the Rationalists there
were some more critical minds—such as
Nazzām—whose attitude towards Greek
Philosophy was not one of servile submission,
but of independent criticism. The defenders
of dogma—Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī, Al-Rāzī, Abul Barakāt,
and Al-Āmidī, carried on a persistent attack
on the whole fabric of Greek Philosophy; while
Abu Sa‘īd Ṣairāfī, Qaḍī ‘Abdal Jabbār, Abul
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_122"></a><a href="images/122.png" class="pgno">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Ma‘ālī, Abul Qāsim, and finally the acute Ibn
Taimiyya, actuated by similar theological
motives, continued to expose the inherent
weakness of Greek Logic. In their criticism
of Greek Philosophy, these thinkers were
supplemented by some of the more learned
Ṣūfīs, such as Shahābal Dīn Suhrawardī, who
endeavoured to substantiate the helplessness
of pure reason by his refutation of Greek
thought in a work entitled, "The unveiling of
Greek absurdities". The A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite reaction
against Rationalism resulted not only in the
development of a system of metaphysics most
modern in some of its aspects, but also in
completely breaking asunder the worn out
fetters of intellectual thraldom. Erdmann<a id="FNanchor_122:1_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_122:1_107" class="fnanchor">[122:1]</a> seems
to think that the speculative spirit among
the Muslims exhausted itself with Al-Fārābī
and Avicenna, and that after them Philosophy
became bankrupt in passing over into
scepticism and mysticism. Evidently he ignores
the Muslim criticism of Greek Philosophy
which led to the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite Idealism on the one
hand, and a genuine Persian reconstruction on
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_123"></a><a href="images/123.png" class="pgno">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the other. That a system of thoroughly Persian
character might be possible, the destruction
of foreign thought, or rather the weakening
of its hold on the mind, was indispensable.
The A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite and other defenders of Islamic
Dogma completed the destruction; Al-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī—the
child of emancipation—came forward to
build a new edifice of thought; though, in his
process of reconstruction, he did not entirely
repudiate the older material. His is the genuine
Persian brain which, undaunted by the threats
of narrow minded authority, asserts its right
of free independent speculation. In his philosophy
the old Iranian tradition, which had found
only a partial expression in the writings of
the Physician Al-Rāzī, Al-<span class="u">Gh</span>azālī, and the
Ismā‘īlia sect, endeavours to come to a final
understanding with the philosophy of his
<ins class="edcorr" title="precessors">predecessors</ins> and the theology of Islam.</p>

<p>Shaikh <span class="u">Sh</span>ahābal Dīn Suhrawardī, known as
<span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>al I<span class="u">sh</span>rāq Maqtūl was born about the
middle of the 12<sup>th</sup> century. He studied philosophy
with Majd Jīlī—the teacher of the
commentator Al-Rāzī—and, while still a
youth, stood unrivalled as a thinker in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_124"></a><a href="images/124.png" class="pgno">[Pg 124]</a></span>
whole Islamic world. His great admirer
Al-Malik-al-Zāhir—the son of Sultan <ins class="mycorr" title="Ṣalā-Ṣalāḥ">Ṣalāḥ</ins>-al
Dīn—invited him to Aleppo, where the
youthful philosopher expounded his independent
opinions in a way that aroused the bitter
jealousy of contemporary theologians. These
hired slaves of bloodthirsty Dogmatism which,
conscious of its inherent weakness, has always
managed to keep brute force behind its back,
wrote to Sultan Ṣalāḥ-al Dīn, that the <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>'s
teaching was a danger to Islam, and that it
was necessary, in the interest of the Faith, to
nip the evil in the bud. The Sultan consented;
and there, at the early age of 36, the young
Persian thinker calmly met the blow which
made him a martyr of truth, and immortalised
his name for ever. Murderers have passed
away, but the philosophy, the price of which
was paid in blood, still lives, and attracts
many an earnest seeker after truth.</p>

<p>The principal features of the founder of the
I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī Philosophy are his intellectual independence,
the skill with which he weaves his
materials into a systematic whole, and above
all his faithfulness to the philosophic traditions
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_125"></a><a href="images/125.png" class="pgno">[Pg 125]</a></span>
of his country. In many fundamental points he
differs from Plato, and freely criticises Aristotle
whose philosophy he looks upon as a mere
preparation for his own system of thought.
Nothing escapes his criticism. Even the logic
of Aristotle, he subjects to a searching examination,
and shows the hollowness of some of
its doctrines. Definition, for instance, is genus
plus differentia, according to Aristotle. But
Al-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī holds that the distinctive attribute
of the thing defined, which cannot be predicated
of any other thing, will bring us no knowledge
of the thing. We define "horse" as a neighing
animal. Now we understand animality, because
we know many animals in which this attribute
exists; but it is impossible to understand the
attribute "neighing", since it is found nowhere
except in the thing defined. The ordinary definition
of horse, therefore, would be meaningless to
a man who has never seen a horse. Aristotelian
definition, as a scientific principle is quite
useless. This criticism leads the <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>, to a
standpoint very similar to that of Bosanquet
who defines definition, as "Summation of
qualities". The <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span> holds that a true definition
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_126"></a><a href="images/126.png" class="pgno">[Pg 126]</a></span>
would enumerate all the essential attributes
which, taken collectively, exist nowhere except
the thing defined, though they may individually
exist in other things.</p>

<p>But let us turn to his system of metaphysics,
and estimate the worth of his contribution to
the thought of his country. In order fully to
comprehend the purely intellectual side of
Transcendental philosophy, the student, says
the <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>, must be thoroughly acquainted with
Aristotelian philosophy, Logic, Mathematics,
and Ṣūfīism. His mind should be completely
free from the taint of prejudice and sin, so
that he may gradually develop that inner
sense, which verifies and corrects what intellect
understands only as theory. Unaided reason is
untrustworthy; it must always be supplemented
by "<span class="u">Dh</span>auq"—the mysterious perception of
the essence of things—which brings knowledge
and peace to the restless soul, and
disarms Scepticism for ever. We are, however,
concerned with the purely speculative side of
this spiritual experience—the results of the
inner perception as formulated and systematised
by discursive thought. Let us, therefore, examine
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_127"></a><a href="images/127.png" class="pgno">[Pg 127]</a></span>
the various aspects of the I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī Philosophy—Ontology,
Cosmology, and Psychology.</p>

<h5>Ontology.</h5>

<p>The ultimate principle of all existence is
"Nūr-i-Qāhir"—the Primal Absolute Light
whose essential nature consists in perpetual
illumination. "Nothing is more visible than
light, and visibility does not stand in need of
any definition."<a id="FNanchor_127:1_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_127:1_108" class="fnanchor">[127:1]</a> The essence of Light, therefore,
is manifestation. For if manifestation is
an attribute superadded to light, it would
follow that in itself light possesses no visibility,
and becomes <ins class="mycorr" title="visibile">visible</ins> only through something
else visible in itself; and from this again
follows the absurd consequence, that something
other than light is more visible than light.
The Primal Light, therefore, has no reason
of its existence beyond itself. All that is other
than this original principle is dependent, contingent,
possible. The "not-light" (darkness)
is not something distinct proceeding from an
independent source. It is an error of the
representatives of the Magian religion to
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_128"></a><a href="images/128.png" class="pgno">[Pg 128]</a></span>
suppose that Light and Darkness are two
distinct realities created by two distinct creative
agencies. The ancient Philosophers of Persia
were not dualists like the Zoroastrian priests
who, on the ground of the principle that the
one cannot cause to emanate from itself more
than one, assigned two independent sources
to Light and Darkness. The relation between
them is not that of contrariety, but of existence
and non-existence. The affirmation of Light
necessarily posits its own negation—Darkness
which it must illuminate in order to be itself.
This Primordial Light is the source of all
motion. But its motion is not change of place;
it is due to the <i>love</i> of illumination which
constitutes its very essence, and stirs it up,
as it were, to quicken all things into life, by
pouring out its own rays into their being. The
number of illuminations which proceed from
it is infinite. Illuminations of intenser brightness
become, in their turn, the sources of other
illuminations; and the scale of brightness
gradually descends to illuminations too faint to
beget other illuminations. All these illuminations
are mediums, or in the language of Theology,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_129"></a><a href="images/129.png" class="pgno">[Pg 129]</a></span>
angels through whom the infinite varieties of
being receive life and sustenance from the
Primal Light. The followers of Aristotle erroneously
restricted the number of original Intellects
to ten. They likewise erred in enumerating
the categories of thought. The possibilities of
the Primal Light are infinite; and the Universe,
with all its variety, is only a partial expression
of the infinitude behind it. The categories of
Aristotle, therefore, are only relatively true.
It is impossible for human thought to
comprehend within its tiny grasp, all the infinite
variety of ideas according to which the Primal
Light does or may illuminate that which is
not light. We can, however, discriminate
between the following two illuminations of the
original Light:—</p>

<p>(1). The Abstract Light (e.g. Intellect
Universal as well as individual). It has no
form, and never becomes the attribute of
anything other than itself (Substance). From it
proceed all the various forms of partly-conscious,
conscious, or self-conscious light, differing from
one another in the amount of lustre, which is
determined by their comparative nearness or
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_130"></a><a href="images/130.png" class="pgno">[Pg 130]</a></span>
distance from the ultimate source of their being.
The individual intellect or soul is only a fainter
copy, or a more distant reflection of the Primal
Light. The Abstract Light knows itself through
itself, and does not stand in need of a non-ego to
reveal its own existence to itself. Consciousness
or self-knowledge, therefore, is the very essense
of Abstract light, as distinguished from the
negation of light.</p>

<p>(2). The Accidental light (Attribute)—the
light that has a form, and is capable of
becoming an attribute of something other than
itself (e.g. the light of the stars, or the visibility
of other bodies). The Accidental light, or more
properly sensible light, is a distant reflection
of the Abstract light, which, because of its
distance, has lost the intensity, or substance-character
of its parent. The process of continuous
reflection is really a softening process;
successive illuminations gradually lose their
intensity until, in the chain of reflections, we
reach certain less intense illuminations which
entirely lose their independent character, and
cannot exist except in association with something
else. These illuminations form the Accidental
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_131"></a><a href="images/131.png" class="pgno">[Pg 131]</a></span>
light—the attribute which has no independent
existence. The relation, therefore, between the
Accidental and the Abstract light is that of
cause and effect. The effect, however, is not
something quite distinct from its cause; it is
a transformation, or a weaker form of the
supposed cause itself. Anything other than the
Abstract light (e.g. the nature of the illuminated
body itself) cannot be the cause of the Accidental
light; since the latter, being merely contingent
and consequently capable of being negatived,
can be taken away from bodies, without affecting
their character. If the essence or nature of the
illuminated body, had been the cause of the
Accidental light, such a process of disillumination
could not have been possible. We cannot
conceive an inactive cause.<a id="FNanchor_131:1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_131:1_109" class="fnanchor">[131:1]</a></p>

<p>It is now obvious that the <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span> al-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāq
agrees with the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite thinkers in holding
that there is no such thing as the Prima
Materia of Aristotle; though he recognises
the existence of a necessary negation of
Light—darkness, the object of illumination.
He further agrees with them in teaching the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_132"></a><a href="images/132.png" class="pgno">[Pg 132]</a></span>
relativity of all categories except Substance
and Quality. But he corrects their theory of
knowledge, in so far as he recognises an active
element in human knowledge. Our relation
with the objects of our knowledge is not merely
a passive relation; the individual soul, being
itself an illumination, illuminates the object in
the act of knowledge. The Universe to him
is one great process of active illumination;
but, from a purely intellectual standpoint, this
illumination is only a partial expression of the
infinitude of the Primal Light, which may
illuminate according to other laws not known
to us. The categories of thought are infinite;
our intellect works with a few only. The
<span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>, therefore, from the standpoint of discursive
thought, is not far from modern Humanism.</p>

<h5>Cosmology.</h5>

<p>All that is "not-light" is, what the I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī
thinkers call, "Absolute quantity", or "Absolute
matter". It is only another aspect of the
affirmation of light, and not an independent
principle, as the followers of Aristotle erroneously
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_133"></a><a href="images/133.png" class="pgno">[Pg 133]</a></span>
hold. The experimental fact of the
transformation of the primary elements into
one another, points to this fundamental Absolute
matter which, with its various degrees of grossness,
constitutes the various spheres of material
being. The absolute ground of all things, then,
is divided into two kinds:—</p>

<p>(1). That which is beyond space—the
obscure substance or atoms (essences of the
A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite).</p>

<p>(2). That which is necessarily in space—forms
of darkness, e.g. weight, smell,
taste, etc.</p>

<p>The combination of these two particularises
the Absolute matter. A material body is forms
of darkness plus obscure substance, made
visible or illuminated by the Abstract light.
But what is the cause of the various forms
of darkness? These, like the forms of light,
owe their existence to the Abstract light, the
different illuminations of which cause diversity
in the spheres of being. The forms which make
bodies differ from one another, do not exist in
the nature of the Absolute matter. The Absolute
quantity and the Absolute matter being identical,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_134"></a><a href="images/134.png" class="pgno">[Pg 134]</a></span>
if these forms do exist in the essence of the
Absolute matter, all bodies would be identical
in regard to the forms of darkness. This,
however, is contradicted by daily experience.
The cause of the forms of darkness, therefore,
is not the Absolute matter. And as the difference
of forms cannot be assigned to any other cause,
it follows that they are due to the various
illuminations of the Abstract light. Forms of
light and darkness both owe their existence
to the Abstract Light. The third element of a
material body—the obscure atom or essence—is
nothing but a necessary aspect of the
affirmation of light. The body as a whole,
therefore, is completely dependent on the
Primal Light. The whole Universe is really
a continuous series of circles of existence, all
depending on the original Light. Those nearer
to the source receive more illumination than
those more distant. All varieties of existence
in each circle, and the circles themselves, are
illuminated through an infinite number of
medium-illuminations, which preserve some
forms of existence by the help of "conscious
light" (as in the case of man, animal and
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_135"></a><a href="images/135.png" class="pgno">[Pg 135]</a></span>
plant), and some without it (as in the case of
minerals and primary elements). The immense
panorama of diversity which we call the
Universe, is, therefore, a vast shadow of the
infinite variety in intensity of direct or indirect
illuminations and rays of the Primary Light.
Things are, so to speak, fed by their respective
illuminations to which they constantly move,
with a lover's passion, in order to drink more
and more of the original fountain of Light.
The world is an eternal drama of love. The
different planes of being are as follow:—</p>

<p>Having briefly indicated the general nature
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_136"></a><a href="images/136.png" class="pgno">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of Being, we now proceed to a more detailed
examination of the world-process. All that is
not-light is divided into:—</p>

<p>(1). Eternal e.g., Intellects, Souls of
heavenly bodies, heavens, simple elements,
time, motion.</p>

<p>(2). Contingent e.g., Compounds of various
elements. The motion of the heavens is eternal,
and makes up the various cycles of the Universe.
It is due to the intense longing of the heaven-soul
to receive illumination from the source of all
light. The matter of which the heavens are
constructed, is completely free from the operation
of chemical processes, incidental to the grosser
forms of the not-light. Every heaven has its
own matter peculiar to it alone. Likewise the
heavens differ from one another in the direction
of their motion; and the difference is explained
by the fact that the beloved, or the sustaining
illumination, is different in each case. Motion
is only an aspect of time. It is the summing
up of the elements of time, which, as externalised,
is motion<ins class="mycorr" title=",">.</ins> The distinction of past,
present, and future is made only for the sake
of convenience, and does not exist in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_137"></a><a href="images/137.png" class="pgno">[Pg 137]</a></span>
nature of time.<a id="FNanchor_137:1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_137:1_110" class="fnanchor">[137:1]</a> We cannot conceive the
beginning of time; for the supposed beginning
would be a point of time itself. Time and
motion, therefore, are both eternal.</p>

<p>There are three primordial elements—water,
earth, and wind. Fire, according to the I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqīs,
is only burning wind. The combinations of
these elements, under various heavenly influences,
assume various forms—fluidity,
gaseousness, solidity. This transformation of
the original elements, constitutes the process
of "making and unmaking" which pervades
the entire sphere of the not-light, raising the
different forms of existence higher and higher,
and bringing them nearer and nearer to the
illuminating forces. All the phenomena of
nature—rain, clouds, thunder, meteor—are
the various workings of this immanent principle
of motion, and are explained by the direct or
indirect operation of the Primal Light on things,
which differ from one another in their capacity
of receiving more or less illumination. The
Universe, in one word, is a petrified desire;
a crystallised longing after light.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_138"></a><a href="images/138.png" class="pgno">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>But is it eternal? The Universe is a manifestation
of the illuminative Power which
constitutes the essential nature of the Primal
Light. In so far, therefore, as it is a manifestation,
it is only a dependent being, and consequently
not eternal. But in another sense it is eternal.
All the different spheres of being exist by the
illuminations and rays of the Eternal light.
There are some illuminations which are directly
eternal; while there are other fainter ones, the
appearance of which depends on the combination
of other illuminations and rays. The existence
of these is not eternal in the same sense
as the existence of the pre-existing parent
illuminations. The existence of colour, for
instance, is contingent in comparison to that
of the ray, which manifests colour when a dark
body is brought before an illuminating body.
The Universe, therefore, though contingent as
manifestation, is eternal by the eternal character
of its source. Those who hold the non-eternity
of the Universe argue on the assumption of
the possibility of a complete induction. Their
argument proceeds in the following manner:—</p>

<p>(1). Everyone of the Abyssinians is black.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_139"></a><a href="images/139.png" class="pgno">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;⁂&nbsp; All Abyssinians are black.</p>

<p>(2). Every motion began at a definite moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;⁂&nbsp; All motion must begin so.</p>

<p>But this mode of argumentation is vicious.
It is quite impossible to state the major. One
cannot collect all the Abyssinians past, present,
and future, at one particular moment of time.
Such a Universal, therefore, is impossible.
Hence from the examination of individual
Abyssinians, or particular instances of motion
which fall within the pale of our experience,
it is rash to infer, that all Abyssinians are
black, or all motion had a beginning in time.</p>

<h5>Psychology.</h5>

<p>Motion and light are not concomitant in
the case of bodies of a lower order. A piece of
stone, for instance, though illuminated and
hence visible, is not endowed with self-initiated
movement. As we rise, however, in the scale
of being, we find higher bodies, or organisms
in which motion and light are associated
together. The abstract illumination finds its
best dwelling place in man. But the question
arises whether the individual abstract illumination
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_140"></a><a href="images/140.png" class="pgno">[Pg 140]</a></span>
which we call the human soul, did or did
not exist before its physical accompaniment.
The founder of I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī Philosophy follows
Avicenna in connection with this question, and
uses the same arguments to show, that the
individual abstract illuminations cannot be held
to have pre-existed, as so many units of light.
The material categories of one and many
cannot be applied to the abstract illumination
which, in its essential nature, is neither one
nor many; though it appears as many owing
to the various degrees of illuminational receptivity
in its material accompaniments. The
relation between the abstract illumination, or
soul and body, is not that of cause and effect;
the bond of union between them is love. The
body which longs for illumination, receives it
through the soul; since its nature does not
permit a direct communication between the
source of light and itself. But the soul cannot
transmit the directly received light to the
dark solid body which, considering its attributes,
stands on the opposite pole of being. In order
to be related to each other, they require a
medium between them, something standing
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_141"></a><a href="images/141.png" class="pgno">[Pg 141]</a></span>
midway between light and darkness. This
medium is the animal soul—a hot, fine,
transparent vapour which has its principal seat
in the left cavity of the heart, but also circulates
in all parts of the body. It is because of the
partial identity of the animal soul with light
that, in dark nights, land-animals run towards
the burning fire; while sea-animals leave their
aquatic abodes in order to enjoy the beautiful
sight of the moon. The ideal of man, therefore,
is to rise higher and higher in the scale of
being, and to receive more and more illumination
which gradually brings complete freedom from
the world of forms. But how is this ideal to
be realised? By knowledge and action. It is
the transformation of both understanding and
will, the union of action and contemplation,
that actualizes the highest ideal of man. Change
your attitude towards the Universe, and adopt
the line of conduct necessitated by the change.
Let us briefly consider these means of
realisation:—</p>

<p>A. <i>Knowledge.</i> When the Abstract illumination
associates itself with a higher organism, it
works out its development by the operation
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_142"></a><a href="images/142.png" class="pgno">[Pg 142]</a></span>
of certain faculties—the powers of light, and
the powers of darkness. The former are the
five external senses, and the five internal
senses—sensorium, conception, imagination,
understanding, and memory; the latter are the
powers of growth, digestion, etc. But such a
division of faculties is only convenient. "One
faculty can be the source of all operations."<a id="FNanchor_142:1_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_142:1_111" class="fnanchor">[142:1]</a>
There is only one power in the middle of the
brain, though it receives different names from
different standpoints. The mind is a unity
which, for the sake of convenience, is regarded
as multiplicity. The power residing in the
middle of the brain must be distinguished from
the abstract illumination which constitutes the
real essence of man. The Philosopher of
illumination appears to draw a distinction
between the active mind and the essentially
inactive soul; yet he teaches that in some
mysterious way, all the various faculties are
connected with the soul.</p>

<p>The most original point in his psychology
of intellection, however, is his <ins class="mycorr" title="theoryof">theory of</ins> vision.
<a id="FNanchor_142:2_112"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_142:2_112" class="fnanchor">[142:2]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_143"></a><a href="images/143.png" class="pgno">[Pg 143]</a></span>
The ray of light which is supposed to come
out of the eye must be either substance or
quality. If quality, it cannot be transmitted
from one substance (eye) to another substance
(visible body). If, on the other hand, it is a
substance, it moves either consciously, or
impelled by its inherent nature. Conscious
movement would make it an animal perceiving
other things. The perceiver in this case would
be the ray, not man. If the movement of the
ray is an attribute of its nature, there is no
reason why its movement should be peculiar
to one direction, and not to all. The ray of
light, therefore, cannot be regarded as coming
out of the eye. The followers of Aristotle hold
that in the process of vision images of objects
are printed on the eye. This view is also
erroneous; since images of big things cannot
be printed on a small space. The truth is
that when a thing comes before the eye, an
illumination takes place, and the mind sees
the object through that illumination. When
there is no veil between the object and the
normal sight, and the mind is ready to perceive,
the act of vision must take place; since this
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_144"></a><a href="images/144.png" class="pgno">[Pg 144]</a></span>
is the law of things. "All vision is illumination;
and we see things in God". Berkley explained
the relativity of our sight-perceptions with a
view to show that the ultimate ground of all
ideas is God. The I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī Philosopher has the
same object in view, though his theory of
vision is not so much an explanation of the
sight-process as a new way of looking at the
fact of vision.</p>

<p>Besides sense and reason, however, there
is another source of knowledge called
"<span class="u">Dh</span>auq"—the inner perception which reveals
non-temporal and non-spatial planes of being.
The study of philosophy, or the habit of
reflecting on pure concepts, combined with the
practice of virtue, leads to the upbringing of
this mysterious sense, which corroborates and
corrects the conclusions of intellect.</p>

<p>B. <i>Action.</i> Man as an active being has the
following motive powers:</p>

<p>(a). Reason or the Angelic soul—the source
of intelligence, discrimination, and love of
knowledge.</p>

<p>(b). The beast-soul which is the source of
anger, courage, dominance, and ambition.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_145"></a><a href="images/145.png" class="pgno">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>(c). The animal soul which is the source of
lust, hunger, and sexual passion.</p>

<p>The first leads to wisdom; the second and
third, if controlled by reason, lead respectively
to bravery and chastity. The harmonious use
of all results in the virtue of justice. The
possibility of spiritual progress by virtue, shows
that this world is the best possible world.
Things as existent are neither good nor bad.
It is misuse or limited standpoint that makes
them so. Still the fact of evil cannot be denied.
Evil does exist; but it is far less in amount
than good. It is peculiar only to a part of
the world of darkness; while there are other
parts of the Universe which are quite free
from the taint of evil. The sceptic who attributes
the existence of evil to the creative agency
of God, presupposes resemblance between
human and divine action, and does not see
that nothing existent is free in his sense of
the word. Divine activity cannot be regarded
as the creator of evil in the same sense as
we regard some forms of human activity as
the cause of evil.<a id="FNanchor_145:1_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_145:1_113" class="fnanchor">[145:1]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_146"></a><a href="images/146.png" class="pgno">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>
<p>It is, then, by the union of knowledge and
virtue that the soul frees itself from the world
of darkness. As we know more and more of
the nature of things, we are brought closer
and closer to the world of light; and the love
of that world becomes more and more intense.
The stages of spiritual development are infinite,
since the degrees of love are infinite. The
principal stages, however, are as follows:—</p>

<p>(1). The stage of "<i>I</i>". In this stage the
feeling of personality is most predominant,
and the spring of human action is generally
selfishness.</p>

<p>(2). The stage of "<i>Thou art not</i>". Complete
absorption in one's own deep self to the entire
forgetfulness of everything external.</p>

<p>(3). The stage of "<i>I am not</i>". This stage
is the necessary result of the second.</p>

<p>(4). The stage of "<i>Thou art</i>". The absolute
negation of "<i>I</i>", and the affirmation of "<i>Thou</i>",
which means complete resignation to the
will of God.</p>

<p>(5). The stage of "<i>I am not; and thou art
not</i>". The complete negation of both the terms
of thought—the state of cosmic consciousness.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_147"></a><a href="images/147.png" class="pgno">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Each stage is marked by more or less
intense illuminations, which are accompanied
by some indescribable sounds. Death does not
put an end to the spiritual progress of the
soul. The individual souls, after death, are not
unified into one soul, but continue different
from each other in proportion to the illumination
they received during their companionship with
physical organisms. The Philosopher of illumination
anticipates Leibniz's doctrine of the
Identity of Indiscernibles, and holds that no
two souls can be completely similar to each
other.<a id="FNanchor_147:1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:1_114" class="fnanchor">[147:1]</a> When the material machinery which
it adopts for the purpose of acquiring gradual
illumination, is exhausted, the soul probably
takes up another body determined by the
experiences of the previous life; and rises
higher and higher in the different spheres
of being, adopting forms peculiar to those
spheres, until it reaches its destination—the
state of absolute negation. Some souls probably
come back to this world in order to make up
their deficiencies.<a id="FNanchor_147:2_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:2_115" class="fnanchor">[147:2]</a> The doctrine of trans-migration
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_148"></a><a href="images/148.png" class="pgno">[Pg 148]</a></span>
cannot be proved or disproved from
a purely logical standpoint; though it is a
probable hypothesis to account for the future
destiny of the soul. All souls are thus constantly
journeying towards their common source, which
calls back the whole Universe when this journey
is over, and starts another cycle of being to
reproduce, in almost all respects, the history
of the preceding cycles.</p>

<p>Such is the philosophy of the great Persian
martyr. He is, properly speaking, the first
Persian systematiser who recognises the
elements of truth in all the aspects of Persian
speculation, and skilfully synthesises them in
his own system. He is a pantheist in so far
as he defines God as the sum total of all
sensible and ideal existence.<a id="FNanchor_148:1_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:1_116" class="fnanchor">[148:1]</a> To him, unlike
some of his Ṣūfī predecessors, the world is
something real, and the human soul a distinct
individuality. With the orthodox theologian,
he <ins class="mycorr" title="mantains">maintains</ins> that the ultimate cause of every
phenomenon, is the absolute light whose
illumination forms the very essence of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_149"></a><a href="images/149.png" class="pgno">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Universe. In his psychology he follows Avicenna,
but his treatment of this branch of
study is more systematic and more empirical.
As an ethical philosopher, he is a follower
of Aristotle whose doctrine of the mean he
explains and illustrates with great thoroughness.
Above all he modifies and transforms the
traditional Neo-Platonism, into a thoroughly
Persian system of thought which, not only
approaches Plato, but also spiritualises the old
Persian Dualism. No Persian thinker is more
alive to the necessity of explaining all the
aspects of objective existence in reference to
his fundamental principles. He constantly
appeals to experience, and endeavours to
explain even the physical phenomena in the
light of his theory of illumination. In his system
objectivity, which was completely swallowed
up by the exceedingly subjective character of
extreme pantheism, claims its due again, and,
having been subjected to a detailed examination,
finds a comprehensive explanation. No wonder
then that this acute thinker succeeded in
founding a system of thought, which has always
exercised the greatest fascination over minds—uniting
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_150"></a><a href="images/150.png" class="pgno">[Pg 150]</a></span>
speculation and emotion in perfect
harmony. The narrow-mindedness of his contemporaries
gave him the title of "Maqtūl"
(the killed one), signifying that he was not to
be regarded as "<span class="u">Sh</span>ahīd" (Martyr); but succeeding
generations of Ṣūfīs and philosophers
have always given him the profoundest
veneration.</p>

<p>I may here notice a less spiritual form of
the I<span class="u">sh</span>rāqī mode of thought. Nasafī<a id="FNanchor_150:1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_150:1_117" class="fnanchor">[150:1]</a> describes
a phase of Ṣūfī thought which reverted to the
old materialistic dualism of Mānī. The advocates
of this view hold, that light and darkness are
essential to each other. They are, in reality,
two rivers which mix with each other like oil
and milk,<a id="FNanchor_150:2_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_150:2_118" class="fnanchor">[150:2]</a> out of which arises the diversity
of things. The ideal of human action is freedom
from the taint of darkness; and the freedom of
light from darkness means the self-consciousness
of light as light.</p>

<h5><a id="Reality_as_Thought"></a>II. Reality as Thought—Al-Jīlī.</h5>

<p>Al-Jīlī was born in 767 A.H., as he himself
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_151"></a><a href="images/151.png" class="pgno">[Pg 151]</a></span>
says in one of his verses, and died in 811
A.H. He was not a prolific writer like <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>
Muḥy al-Dīn ibn ‘Arabī whose mode of thought
seems to have greatly influenced his teaching.
He combined in himself poetical imagination
and philosophical genius, but his poetry is no
more than a vehicle for his mystical and
metaphysical doctrines. Among other books he
wrote a commentary on <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span> Muḥy al-Dīn ibn
‘Arabī's al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiya, a commentary
on Bismillāh, and the famous work Insān
al-Kāmil (printed in Cairo).</p>

<p>Essence pure and simple, he says, is the
thing to which names and attributes are given,
whether it is existent actually or ideally. The
existent is of two species:—</p>

<p>(1). The Existent in Absoluteness or Pure
existence—Pure Being—God.</p>

<p>(2). The existence joined with non-existence—Creation—Nature.</p>

<p>The Essence of God or Pure Thought cannot
be understood; no words can express it, for it
is beyond all relation and knowledge is relation.
The intellect flying through the fathomless
empty space pierces through the veil of names
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_152"></a><a href="images/152.png" class="pgno">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and attributes, traverses the vasty sphere of
time, enters the domain of the non-existent
and finds the Essence of Pure Thought to be
an existence which is non-existence—a sum
of contradictions.<a id="FNanchor_152:1_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_152:1_119" class="fnanchor">[152:1]</a> It has two (accidents);
eternal life in all past time and eternal life in
all future time. It has two (qualities), God and
creation. It has two (definitions), uncreatableness
and creatableness. It has two names,
God and man. It has two faces, the manifested
(this world) and the unmanifested (the next
world). It has two effects, necessity and
possibility. It has two points of view; from
the first it is non-existent for itself but existent
for what is not itself; from the second it is
existent for itself and non-existent for what
is not itself.</p>

<p>Name, he says, fixes the named in the
understanding, pictures it in the mind, presents
it in the imagination and keeps it in the
memory. It is the outside or the husk, as it
were, of the named; while the named is the
inside or the pith. Some names do not exist
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_153"></a><a href="images/153.png" class="pgno">[Pg 153]</a></span>
in reality but exist in name only as "‘Anqā"
(a fabulous bird). It is a name the object of
which does not exist in reality. Just as "‘Anqā"
is absolutely non-existent, so God is absolutely
present, although He cannot be touched and
seen. The "‘Anqā" exists only in idea while
the object of the name "Allāh" exists in
reality and can be known like "‘Anqā" only
through its names and attributes. The name
is a mirror which reveals all the secrets of
the Absolute Being; it is a light through the
agency of which God sees Himself. Al-Jīlī here
approaches the Isma‘īlia view that we should
seek the Named through the Name.</p>

<p>In order to understand this passage we
should bear in mind the three stages of the
development of Pure Being, enumerated by
him. He holds that the Absolute existence or
Pure Being when it leaves its absoluteness
undergoes three stages:—(1) Oneness. (2)
<ins class="edcorr" title="an He-ness">He-ness</ins>. (3) I-ness. In the first stage there is
an absence of all attributes and relations, yet it
is called one, and therefore oneness marks one
step away from the absoluteness. In the second
stage Pure Being is yet free from all manifestation,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_154"></a><a href="images/154.png" class="pgno">[Pg 154]</a></span>
while the third stage, I-ness, is nothing
but an external manifestation of the He-ness;
or, as Hegel would say, it is the self-diremption
of God. This third stage is the sphere of the
name Allāh; here the darkness of Pure Being
is illuminated, nature comes to the front, the
Absolute Being has become conscious. He says
further that the name Allāh is the stuff of
all the perfections of the different phases of
Divinity, and in the second stage of the progress
of Pure Being, all that is the result of Divine
self-diremption was potentially contained within
the titanic grasp of this name which, in the
third stage of the development, objectified
itself, became a mirror in which God reflected
Himself, and thus by its crystallisation dispelled
all the gloom of the Absolute Being.</p>

<p>In correspondence with these three stages
of the absolute development, the perfect
man has three stages of spiritual training.
But in his case the process of development
must be the reverse; because his is the
process of ascent, while the Absolute Being
had undergone essentially a process of descent.
In the first stage of his spiritual progress he
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_155"></a><a href="images/155.png" class="pgno">[Pg 155]</a></span>
meditates on the name, studies nature on which
it is sealed; in the second stage he steps
into the sphere of the Attribute, and in the
third stage enters the sphere of the Essence.
It is here that he becomes the Perfect Man;
his eye becomes the eye of God, his word
the word of God and his life the life of
God—participates in the general life of Nature
and "sees into the life of things".</p>

<p>To turn now to the nature of the
attribute. His views on this most interesting
question are very important, because
it is here that his doctrine fundamentally differs
from Hindu Idealism. He defines attribute
as an agency which gives us a knowledge of
the state of things.<a id="FNanchor_155:1_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_155:1_120" class="fnanchor">[155:1]</a> Elsewhere he says that
this distinction of attribute from the underlying
reality is tenable only in the sphere of the
manifested, because here every attribute is
regarded as the other of the reality in which
it is supposed to inhere. This otherness is due
to the existence of combination and disintegration
in the sphere of the manifested. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_156"></a><a href="images/156.png" class="pgno">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the distinction is untenable in the domain of
the unmanifested, because there is no
combination or disintegration there. It should
be observed how widely he differs from the
advocates of the Doctrine of "Māyā". He
believes that the material world has real
existence; it is the outward husk of the real
being, no doubt, but this outward husk is not
the less real. The cause of the phenomenal
world, according to him, is not a real entity
hidden behind the sum of attributes, but it is
a conception furnished by the mind so that
there may be no difficulty in understanding
the material world. Berkeley and Fichte
will so far agree with our author, but his
view leads him to the most characteristically
Hegelian doctrine—identity of thought
and being. In the 37<sup>th</sup> chapter of the
2<sup>nd</sup> volume of Insān al-Kāmil, he clearly says
that idea is the stuff of which this universe
is made; thought, idea, notion is the material
of the structure of nature. While laying stress
on this doctrine he says, "Dost thou not look
to thine own belief? Where is the reality in
which the so-called Divine attributes inhere?
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_157"></a><a href="images/157.png" class="pgno">[Pg 157]</a></span>
It is but the idea."<a id="FNanchor_157:1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_157:1_121" class="fnanchor">[157:1]</a> Hence nature is nothing
but a crystallised idea. He gives his
hearty assent to the results of Kant's <i>Critique
of Pure Reason</i>; but, unlike him, he
makes this very idea the essence of the Universe.
Kant's <i>Ding an sich</i> to him is a pure
nonentity; there is nothing behind the collection
of attributes. The attributes are the real
things, the material world is but the objectification
of the Absolute Being; it is the other
self of the Absolute—another which owes its
existence to the principle of difference in the
nature of the Absolute itself. Nature is the
idea of God, a something necessary for His
knowledge of Himself. While Hegel calls his
doctrine the identity of thought and being,
Al-Jīlī calls it the identity of attribute and
reality. It should be noted that the author's
phrase, "world of attributes", which he uses
for the material world is slightly misleading.
What he really holds is that the distinction
of attribute and reality is merely phenomenal,
and does not at all exist in the nature of
things. It is useful, because it facilitates our
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_158"></a><a href="images/158.png" class="pgno">[Pg 158]</a></span>
understanding of the world around us, but it
is not at all real. It will be understood that
Al-Jīlī recognises the truth of Empirical
Idealism only tentatively, and does not admit
the absoluteness of the distinction. These
remarks should not lead us to understand that
Al-Jīlī does not believe in the objective
reality of the thing in itself. He does believe
in it, but then he advocates its unity, and says
that the material world is the thing in itself;
it is the "other", the external expression of
the thing in itself. The <i>Ding an sich</i> and its
external expression or the production of its
self-diremption, are really <ins class="mycorr" title="indentical">identical</ins>, though
we discriminate between them in order to
facilitate our understanding of the universe. If
they are not identical, he says, how could one
manifest the other? In one word, he means by
<i>Ding an sich</i>, the Pure, the Absolute Being,
and seeks it through its manifestation or external
expression. He says that as long as we do not
realise the identity of attribute and reality, the
material world or the world of attributes seems
to be a veil; but when the doctrine is brought
home to us the veil is removed; we see the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_159"></a><a href="images/159.png" class="pgno">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Essence itself everywhere, and find that all the
attributes are but ourselves. Nature then appears
in her true light; all otherness is removed and
we are one with her. The aching prick of curiosity
ceases, and the inquisitive attitude of our
minds is replaced by a state of philosophic
calm. To the person who has realised this
identity, discoveries of science bring no new
information, and religion with her <i>role</i> of
supernatural authority has nothing to say.
This is the spiritual emancipation.</p>

<p>Let us now see how he classifies the different
divine names and attributes which have
received expression in nature or crystallised
Divinity. His classification is as follows:—</p>

<p>(1). The names and attributes of God as
He is in Himself (Allāh, The One, The Odd,
The Light, The Truth, The Pure, The Living.)</p>

<p>(2). The names and attributes of God as
the source of all glory (The Great and High,
The All-powerful).</p>

<p>(3). The names and attributes of God as
all Perfection (The Creator, The Benefactor,
The First, The Last).</p>

<p>(4). The names and attributes of God as
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_160"></a><a href="images/160.png" class="pgno">[Pg 160]</a></span>
all Beauty (The Uncreatable, The Painter,
The Merciful, The Origin of all). Each of
these names and attributes has its own particular
effect by which it illuminates the soul of the
perfect man and Nature. How these illuminations
take place, and how they reach the soul is
not explained by Al-Jīlī. His silence about
these matters throws into more relief the
mystical portion of his views and implies the
necessity of spiritual Directorship.</p>

<p>Before considering Al-Jīlī's views of particular
Divine Names and Attributes, we should
note that his conception of God, implied
in the above classification, is very similar to
that of Schleiermacher. While the German
theologian reduces all the divine attributes
to one single attribute of Power, our author
sees the danger of advancing a God free from
all attributes, yet recognises with Schleiermacher
that in Himself God is an unchangeable
unity, and that His attributes "are nothing
more than views of Him from different human
standpoints, the various appearances which the
one changeless cause presents to our finite
intelligence according as we look at it from
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_161"></a><a href="images/161.png" class="pgno">[Pg 161]</a></span>
different sides of the spiritual landscape."<a id="FNanchor_161:1_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_161:1_122" class="fnanchor">[161:1]</a> In
His absolute existence He is beyond the
limitation of names and attributes, but when
He externalises Himself, when He leaves His
absoluteness, when nature is born, names and
attributes appear sealed on her very fabric.</p>

<p>We now proceed to consider what he
teaches about particular Divine Names and
Attributes. The first Essential Name is Allāh
(Divinity) which means the sum of all the
realities of existence with their respective order
in that sum. This name is applied to God as
the only necessary existence. Divinity being
the highest manifestation of Pure Being, the
difference between them is that the latter is
visible to the eye, but its <i>where</i> is invisible;
while the traces of the former are visible, itself
is invisible. By the very fact of her being
crystallised divinity, Nature is not the real
divinity; hence Divinity is invisible, and its
traces in the form of Nature are visible to the
eye. Divinity, as the author illustrates, is water;
nature is crystallised water or ice; but ice is
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_162"></a><a href="images/162.png" class="pgno">[Pg 162]</a></span>
not water. The Essence is visible to the eye,
(another proof of our author's Natural Realism
or Absolute Idealism) although all its attributes
are not known to us. Even its attributes are
not known as they are in themselves, their
shadows or effects only are known. For instance,
charity itself is unknown, only its effect or the fact
of giving to the poor, is known and seen.
This is due to the attributes being incorporated
in the very nature of the Essence. If the
expression of the attributes in its real nature
had been possible, its separation from the
Essence would have been possible also. But
there are some other Essential Names of
God—The Absolute Oneness and Simple
Oneness. The Absolute Oneness marks <ins class="mycorr" title="the the">the</ins>
first step of Pure Thought from the darkness
of Cecity (the internal or the original Māyā
of the Vedānta) to the light of manifestation.
Although this movement is not attended with
any external manifestations, yet it sums up
all of them under its hollow universality. Look
at a wall, says the author, you see the whole
wall; but you cannot see the individual pieces
of the material that contribute to its formation.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_163"></a><a href="images/163.png" class="pgno">[Pg 163]</a></span>
The wall is a unity—but a unity which
comprehends diversity, so Pure Being is a
unity but a unity which is the soul of diversity.</p>

<p>The third movement of the Absolute Being
is Simple Oneness—a step attended with
external manifestation. The Absolute Oneness
is free from all particular names and attributes.
The Oneness Simple takes on names and
attributes, but there is no distinction between
these attributes, one is the essence of the other.
Divinity is similar to Simple Oneness, but its
names and attributes are distinguished from one
another and even contradictory, as generous
is contradictory to revengeful.<a id="FNanchor_163:1_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_163:1_123" class="fnanchor">[163:1]</a> The third step,
or as Hegel would say, Voyage of the Being,
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_164"></a><a href="images/164.png" class="pgno">[Pg 164]</a></span>
has another appellation (Mercy). The First
Mercy, the author says, is the evolution of
the Universe from Himself and the manifestation
of His own Self in every atom of the result
of His own self-diremption. Al-Jīlī makes this
point clearer by an instance. He says that
nature is frozen water and God is water. The
real name of nature is God (Allāh); ice or
condensed water is merely a borrowed appellation.
Elsewhere he calls water the origin of
knowledge, intellect, understanding, thought
and idea. This instance leads him to guard
against the error of looking upon God as
immanent in nature, or running through the
sphere of material existence. He says that
immanence implies disparity of being; God is
not immanent because He is Himself the
existence. Eternal existence is the other self
of God, it is the light through which He sees
Himself. As the originator of an idea is existent
in that idea, so God is present in nature.
The difference between God and man, as one
may say, is that His ideas materialise themselves,
ours do not. It will be remembered here that
Hegel would use the same line of argument
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_165"></a><a href="images/165.png" class="pgno">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in freeing himself from the accusation of
Pantheism.</p>

<p>The attribute of Mercy is closely connected
with the attribute of Providence. He defines
it as the sum of all that existence stands in
need of. Plants are supplied with water through
the force of this name. The natural philosopher
would express the same thing differently; he
would speak of the same phenomena as resulting
from the activity of a certain force of nature;
Al-Jīlī would call it a manifestation of Providence;
but, unlike the natural philosopher, he would
not advocate the unknowability of that force.
He would say that there is nothing behind it,
it is the Absolute Being itself.</p>

<p>We have now finished all the essential
names and attributes of God, and proceed to
examine the nature of what existed before all
things. The Arabian Prophet, says Al-Jīlī, was
once questioned about the place of God before
creation. He said that God, before the creation,
existed in "‘Amā" (Blindness). It is the nature
of this Blindness or primal darkness which we
now proceed to examine. The investigation is
particularly interesting, because the word translated
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_166"></a><a href="images/166.png" class="pgno">[Pg 166]</a></span>
into modern phraseology would be "<i>The
Unconsciousness</i>". This single word impresses
upon us the foresightedness with which he
anticipates metaphysical doctrines of modern
Germany. He says that the Unconsciousness is
the reality of all realities; it is the Pure Being
without any descending movement; it is free
from the attributes of God and creation; it does
not stand in need of any name or quality,
because it is beyond the sphere of relation.
It is distinguished from the Absolute Oneness
because the latter name is applied to the Pure
Being in its process of coming down towards
manifestation. It should, however, be remembered
that when we speak of the priority of
God and posteriority of creation, our words
must not be understood as implying time; for
there can be no duration of time or separateness
between God and His creation. Time,
continuity in space and time, are themselves
creations, and how can piece of creation
intervene between God and His creation. Hence
our words before, after, where, whence, etc.,
in this sphere of thought, should not be
construed to imply time or space. The real
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_167"></a><a href="images/167.png" class="pgno">[Pg 167]</a></span>
thing is beyond the grasp of human conceptions;
no category of material existence can be
applicable to it; because, as Kant would say,
the laws of phenomena cannot be spoken of
as obtaining in the sphere of noumena.</p>

<p>We have already noticed that man in his
progress towards perfection has three stages:
the first is the meditation of the name which
the author calls the illumination of names. He
remarks that "When God illuminates a certain
man by the light of His names, the man is
destroyed under the dazzling splendour of that
name; and "when thou calleth God, the call
is responded to by the man". The effect of
this illumination would be, in Schopenhauer's
language, the destruction of the individual will,
yet it must not be confounded with physical
death; because the individual goes on living
and moving like the spinning wheel, as Kapila
would say, after he has become one with
Prakriti. It is here that the individual cries
out in pantheistic mood:—She was I and I
was she and there was none to separate us."<a id="FNanchor_167:1_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:1_124" class="fnanchor">[167:1]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_168"></a><a href="images/168.png" class="pgno">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>The second stage of the spiritual training
is what he calls the illumination of the Attribute.
This illumination makes the perfect man receive
the attributes of God in their real nature in
proportion to the power of receptivity possessed
by him—a fact which classifies men according
to the magnitude of this light resulting from
the illumination. Some men receive illumination
from the divine attribute of Life, and thus
participate in the soul of the Universe. The
effect of this light is soaring in the air, walking
on water, changing the magnitude of things
(as Christ so often did). In this wise the
perfect man receives illumination from all the
Divine attributes, crosses the sphere of the
name and the attribute, and steps into the
domain of the Essence—Absolute Existence.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the Absolute
Being, when it leaves its absoluteness, has
three voyages to undergo, each voyage being
a process of particularisation of the bare
universality of the Absolute Essence. Each of
these three movements appears under a new
Essential Name which has its own peculiar
illuminating effect upon the human soul. Here
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_169"></a><a href="images/169.png" class="pgno">[Pg 169]</a></span>
is the end of our author's spiritual ethics;
<i>man has become perfect</i>, he has amalgamated
himself with the Absolute Being, or <i>has learnt
what Hegel calls The Absolute Philosophy</i>. "He
becomes the paragon of perfection, the object
of worship, the preserver of the Universe".<a id="FNanchor_169:1_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_169:1_125" class="fnanchor">[169:1]</a>
He is the point where Man-ness and God-ness
become one, and result in the birth of the
god-man.</p>

<p>How the perfect man reaches this height
of spiritual development, the author does not
tell us; but he says that at every stage he
has a peculiar experience in which there is
not even a trace of doubt or agitation. The
instrument of this experience is what he calls
the <i>Qalb</i> (heart), a word very difficult of
definition. He gives a very mystical diagram
of the Qalb, and explains it by saying that
it is the eye which sees the names, the attributes
and the Absolute Being successively. It owes
its existence to a mysterious combination of
soul and mind; and becomes by its very nature
the organ for the recognition of the ultimate
realities of existence. All that the "heart", or
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_170"></a><a href="images/170.png" class="pgno">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the source of what the Vedānta calls the
Higher Knowledge, reveals is not seen by the
individual as something separate from and
heterogeneous to himself; what is shown to
him through this agency is his own reality,
his own deep being. This characteristic of the
agency differentiates it from the intellect, the
object of which is always different and separate
from the individual exercising that faculty. But
the spiritual experience, according to the Ṣūfīs
of this school, is not permanent; moments of
spiritual vision, says Matthew Arnold,<a id="FNanchor_170:1_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:1_126" class="fnanchor">[170:1]</a> cannot
be at our command. The god-man is he who
has known the mystery of his own being, who
has realised himself as god-man; but when
that particular spiritual realisation is over man
is man and God is God. Had the experience
been permanent, a great moral force would
have been lost and society overturned.</p>

<p>Let us now sum up Al-Jīlī's <i>Doctrine of
the Trinity</i>. We have seen the three movements
of the Absolute Being, or the first three
categories of Pure Being; we have also seen
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_171"></a><a href="images/171.png" class="pgno">[Pg 171]</a></span>
that the third movement is attended with
external manifestation, which is the self-diremption
of the Essence into God and man. This
separation makes a gap which is filled by
the perfect man, who shares in both the
Divine and the human attributes. He holds
that the perfect man is the preserver of the
Universe; hence in his view, the appearance
of the perfect man is a necessary condition
for the continuation of nature. It is easy,
therefore, to understand that in the god-man,
the Absolute Being which has left its absoluteness,
returns into itself; and, but for the
god-man, it could not have done so; for then
there would have been no nature, and consequently
no light through which God could
have seen Himself. The light through the
agency of which God sees Himself is due to
the principle of difference in the nature of
the Absolute Being itself. He recognises this
principle in the following verses:—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If you say that God is one, you are right; but if you say that He is two, this is also true.<br />
If you say no, but He is three, you are right, for this is the real nature of man.
<a id="FNanchor_171:1_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_171:1_127" class="fnanchor">[171:1]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_172"></a><a href="images/172.png" class="pgno">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>perfect man</i>, then, is the joining link.
On the one hand he receives illumination from
all the Essential names, on the other hand all
Divine attributes reappear in him. These
attributes are:—</p>

<p>1. Independent life or existence.</p>

<p>2. Knowledge which is a form of life, as
he proves from a verse from the Qur’an.</p>

<p>3. Will—the principle of particularisation,
or the manifestation of Being. He defines it
as the illumination of the knowledge of God
according to the requirements of the Essence;
hence it is a particular form of knowledge.
It has nine manifestations, all of which are
different names for love; the last is the love
in which the lover and the beloved, the knower
and the known merge into each other, and
become identical. This form of love, he says,
is the Absolute Essence; as Christianity teaches,
God is love. He guards, here, against the
error of looking upon the individual act of
will as uncaused. Only the act of the universal
will is uncaused; hence he implies the Hegelian
Doctrine of Freedom, and holds that the acts
of man are both free and determined.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_173"></a><a href="images/173.png" class="pgno">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>4. Power, which expresses itself in self-diremption
i.e. creation. He controverts <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>
Muḥy al-Dīn ibn ‘Arabī's position that the
Universe existed before the creation in the
knowledge of God. He says, this would imply
that God did not create it out of nothing, and
holds that the Universe, before its existence
as an idea, existed in the self of God.</p>

<p>5. The word or the reflected being. Every
possibility is the word of God; hence nature
is the materialisation of the word of God. It
has different names—The tangible word, The
sum of the realities of man, The arrangement
of the Divinity, The spread of Oneness, The
expression of the Unknown, The phases of
Beauty, The trace of names and attributes,
and the object of God's knowledge.</p>

<p>6. The Power of hearing the inaudible.</p>

<p>7. The Power of seeing the invisible.</p>

<p>8. Beauty—that which seems least beautiful
in nature (the reflected beauty) is in its real
existence, beauty. Evil is only relative, it has
no real existence; sin is merely a relative
deformity.</p>

<p>9. Glory or beauty in its intensity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_174"></a><a href="images/174.png" class="pgno">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>10. Perfection, which is the unknowable
essence of God and therefore Unlimited and
Infinite.</p>

<span>LATER PERSIAN THOUGHT.</span></h3>

<p>Under the rude Tartar invaders of Persia,
who could have no sympathy with independent
thought, there could be no progress of ideas.
Ṣūfīism, owing to its association with religion,
went on systematising old and evolving new
ideas. But philosophy proper was distasteful
to the Tartar. Even the development of Islamic
law suffered a check; since the Ḥanafite law
was the acme of human reason to the Tartar,
and further subtleties of legal interpretation
were disagreeable to his brain. Old schools of
thought lost their solidarity, and many thinkers
left their native country to find more favourable
conditions elsewhere. In the 16<sup>th</sup> century we
find Persian Aristotelians—Dastūr Isfahānī,
Hīr Bud, Munīr, and Kāmrān—travelling in
India, where the Emperor Akbar was drawing
upon Zoroastrianism to form a new faith for
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_175"></a><a href="images/175.png" class="pgno">[Pg 175]</a></span>
himself and his courtiers, who were mostly
Persians. No great thinker, however, appeared
in Persia until the 17<sup>th</sup> century, when the
acute Mulla Ṣadra of <span class="u">Sh</span>īrāz upheld his philosophical
system with all the vigour of his
powerful logic. With Mulla Ṣadra Reality is
all things yet is none of them, and true
knowledge consists in the identity of the
subject and the object. De Gobineau thinks that
the philosophy of Ṣadra is a mere revival
of Avicennaism. He, however, ignores the fact
that Mulla Ṣadra's doctrine of the identity of
subject and object constitutes the final step
which the Persian intellect took towards
complete monism. It is moreover the Philosophy
of Ṣadra which is the source of the metaphysics
of early Bābism.</p>

<p>But the movement towards Platonism is
best illustrated in Mulla Hādī of Sabzwār who
flourished in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, and is believed
by his countrymen to be the greatest of
modern Persian thinkers. As a specimen of
comparatively recent Persian speculation, I may
briefly notice here the views of this great
thinker, as set forth in his Asrār al-Ḥikam
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_176"></a><a href="images/176.png" class="pgno">[Pg 176]</a></span>
(published in Persia). A glance at his philosophical
teaching reveals three fundamental
conceptions which are indissolubly associated
with the Post-Islamic Persian thought:—</p>

<p>1. The idea of the Absolute Unity of the
Real which is described as "Light".</p>

<p>2. The idea of evolution which is dimly
visible in Zoroaster's doctrine of the destiny
of the human soul, and receives further
expansion and systematisation by Persian
Neo-Platonists and Ṣūfī thinkers.</p>

<p>3. The idea of a medium between the Absolute
Real and the Not-real.</p>

<p>It is highly interesting to note how the
Persian mind gradually got rid of the Emanation
theory of Neo-Platonism, and reached a purer
notion of Plato's Philosophy. The Arab
Muhammadans of Spain, by a similar process
of elimination reached, through the same
medium (Neo-Platonism) a truer conception of
the Philosophy of Aristotle—a fact which
illustrates the genius of the two races. Lewes
in his Biographical History of Philosophy
remarks that the Arabs eagerly took up the
study of Aristotle simply because Plato was
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_177"></a><a href="images/177.png" class="pgno">[Pg 177]</a></span>
not presented to them. I am, however, inclined
to think that the Arab genius was thoroughly
practical; hence Plato's philosophy would have
been distasteful to them even if it had been
presented in its true light. Of the systems of
Greek philosophy Neo-Platonism, I believe,
was the only one which was presented in its
completeness to the Muslim world; yet patient
critical research led the Arab from Plotinus
to Aristotle, and the Persian to Plato. This
is singularly illustrated in the Philosophy of
Mulla Hādī, who recognises no Emanations,
and approaches the Platonic conception of the
Real. He illustrates, moreover, how philosophical
speculation in Persia, as in all countries where
Physical science either does not exist or is
not studied, is finally absorbed by religion.
The "Essence", i.e. the metaphysical cause
as distinguished from the scientific cause, which
means the sum of antecedent conditions, must
gradually be transformed into "Personal Will"
(cause, in a religious sense) in the absence of
any other notion of cause. And this is perhaps
the deeper reason why Persian philosophies
have always ended in religion.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_178"></a><a href="images/178.png" class="pgno">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now turn to Mulla Hādī's system
of thought. He teaches that Reason has two
aspects:—(a) Theoretical, the object of
which is Philosophy and Mathematics, (b)
Practical, the object of which is Domestic
Economy, Politics, etc. Philosophy proper
comprises the knowledge of the beginning of
things, the end of things, and the knowledge
of the Self. It also includes the knowledge of
the law of God—which is identical with
religion. In order to understand the origin
of things, we should subject to a searching
analysis the various phenomena of the Universe.
Such an analysis reveals that there are three
original principles.<a id="FNanchor_178:1_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:1_128" class="fnanchor">[178:1]</a></p>

<p>(1). The Real—Light.</p>

<p>(2). The Shadow.</p>

<p>(3). The not-Real—Darkness.</p>

<p>The Real is absolute, and necessary as
distinguished from the "Shadow", which is
relative and contingent. In its nature it is
absolutely good; and the proposition that it
is good, is self-evident.<a id="FNanchor_178:2_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:2_129" class="fnanchor">[178:2]</a> All forms of potential
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_179"></a><a href="images/179.png" class="pgno">[Pg 179]</a></span>
existence, before they are actualised by the
Real, are open to both existence or non-existence,
and the possibilities of their existence or non-existence
are exactly equal. It, therefore, follows
that the Real which actualises the potential
is not itself non-existence; since non-existence
operating on non-existence cannot produce
actuality.<a id="FNanchor_179:1_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:1_130" class="fnanchor">[179:1]</a> Mulla Hādī, in his conception of
the Real as the operator, modifies Plato's
statical conception of the Universe, and,
following Aristotle, looks upon his Real as
the immovable source and the object of all
motion. "All things in the Universe," he says,
"love perfection, and are moving towards their
final ends—minerals towards vegetables,
vegetables towards animals, and animals
towards man. And observe how man passes
through all these stages in the mother's womb."<a id="FNanchor_179:2_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:2_131" class="fnanchor">[179:2]</a>
The mover as mover is either the source or
the object of motion or both. In any case the
mover must be either movable or immovable.
The proposition that all movers must be
themselves movable, leads to infinite regress—which
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_180"></a><a href="images/180.png" class="pgno">[Pg 180]</a></span>
must stop at the immovable mover, the
source and the final object of all motion. The
Real, moreover, is a pure unity; for if there
is a plurality of Reals, one would limit the
other. The Real as creator also cannot be
conceived as more than one; since a plurality
of creators would mean a plurality of worlds
which must be circular touching one another,
and this again implies vacuum which is
impossible.<a id="FNanchor_180:1_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_180:1_132" class="fnanchor">[180:1]</a> Regarded as an essence, therefore,
the Real is one. But it is also many, from a
different <ins class="mycorr" title="staindpoint">standpoint</ins>. It is life, power, love;
though we cannot say that these qualities
inhere in it—they are it, and it is them.
Unity does not mean oneness, its essence
consists in the "dropping of all relations."
Unlike the Ṣūfīs and other thinkers, Mulla
Hādī holds and tries to show that belief in
multiplicity is not inconsistent with belief in
unity; since the visible "many" is nothing more
than a manifestation of the names and attributes
of the Real. These attributes are the various
forms of a "Knowledge" which constitutes the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_181"></a><a href="images/181.png" class="pgno">[Pg 181]</a></span>
very essence of the Real. To speak, however,
of the attributes of the Real is only a verbal
convenience; since "defining the Real is
applying the category of number to it"—an
absurd process which endeavours to bring the
unrelated into the sphere of the related. The
Universe, with all its variety, is the shadow
of the various names and attributes of the
Real or the Absolute Light. It is Reality
unfolded, the "Be", or the word of Light.<a id="FNanchor_181:1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_181:1_133" class="fnanchor">[181:1]</a>
Visible multiplicity is the illumination of
Darkness, or the actualisation of Nothing.
Things are different because we see them, as it
were, through glasses of different colours—the
Ideas. In this connection Hādī approvingly
quotes the poet Jāmī who has given the most
beautiful poetic expression to Plato's Doctrine
of Ideas in verses which can be thus translated:—</p>

<p>"The ideas are glasses of various colours
in which the Sun of Reality reflects itself, and
makes itself visible through them according
as they are red, yellow or blue."<a id="FNanchor_181:2_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_181:2_134" class="fnanchor">[181:2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_182"></a><a href="images/182.png" class="pgno">[Pg 182]</a></span></p><p>In his Psychology he mostly follows Avicenna,
but his treatment of the subject is more
thorough and systematic. He classifies the soul
in the following manner:—</p>

<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>The animal soul has three powers:—</p>

<div>
<table class="margleft" border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Powers of animal soul.">
<tr><td>1. External senses</td><td rowspan="2" class="trbbr">&nbsp;</td><td rowspan="2">Perception.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="3" class="desc2">(a) Voluntary motion.</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="3" class="desc2">(b) Involuntary motion.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The external senses are taste, touch, smell,
hearing and sight. The sound exists outside
the ear, and not inside as some thinkers have
held. For if it does not exist outside the ear,
it is not possible to perceive its direction and
distance. Hearing and sight are superior to
other senses, and sight is superior to hearing;
since:
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_183"></a><a href="images/183.png" class="pgno">[Pg 183]</a></span>—</p>

<p>I. The eye can perceive distant things.</p>

<p>II. Its perception is light, which is the best
of all attributes.</p>

<p>III. The construction of the eye is more
complicated and delicate than that of
the ear.</p>

<p>IV. The perceptions of sight are things which
actually exist, while those of hearing
resemble non-existence.</p>

<p>The internal senses are as follow:—</p>

<p>(1). The Common Sense—the tablet of
the mind. It is like the Prime Minister of the
mind sending out five spies (external senses)
to bring in news from the external world.
When we say "this white thing is sweet",
we perceive whiteness and sweetness by sight
and taste respectively, but that both the
attributes exist in the same thing is decided
by the Common Sense. The line made by a
falling drop, so far as the eye is concerned,
is nothing but the drop. But what is the line
which we see? To account for such a phenomenon,
says Hādī, it is necessary to postulate
another sense which perceives the lengthening
of the falling drop into a line.
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_184"></a><a href="images/184.png" class="pgno">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>(2). The faculty which preserves the perceptions
of the Common Sense—images and
not ideas like the memory. The judgment that
whiteness and sweetness exist in the same
thing is completed by this faculty; since, if it
does not preserve the image of the subject,
Common Sense cannot perceive the predicate.</p>

<p>(3). The power which perceives individual
ideas. The sheep thinks of the enmity of the
wolf, and runs away from him. Some forms
of life lack this power, e.g. the moth which
hurls itself against the candle-flame.</p>

<p>(4). Memory—the preserver of ideas.</p>

<p>(5). The power of combining images
and ideas, e.g. the winged man. When
this faculty works under the guidance of the
power which perceives individual ideas, it is
called Imagination; when it works under the
control of Intellect, it is called Conception.</p>

<p>But it is the spirit which distinguishes man
from other animals. This essence of humanity
is a "unity", not oneness. It perceives the
Universal by itself, and the particular through
the external and the internal senses. It is the
shadow of the Absolute Light, and like it
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_185"></a><a href="images/185.png" class="pgno">[Pg 185]</a></span>
manifests itself in various ways—comprehending
multiplicity in its unity. There is no
necessary relation between the spirit and the
body. The former is non-temporal and non-spatial;
hence it is changeless, and has the
power of judging the visible multiplicity. In
sleep the spirit uses the "ideal body" which
functions like the physical body; in waking
life it uses the ordinary physical body. It
follows, therefore, that the spirit stands in
need of neither, and uses both at will. Hādī
does not follow Plato in his doctrine of transmigration,
the different forms of which he
refutes at length. The spirit to him is immortal,
and reaches its original home—Absolute
Light—by the gradual perfection of its
faculties. The various stages of the development
of reason are as follows:—</p>

<p>
A. Theoretical or Pure Reason—<br />
<br />
<span class="m1">1<sup>st</sup> Potential Reason.</span><br />
<span class="m1">2<sup>nd</sup> Perception of self-evident propositions.</span><br />
<span class="m1">3<sup>rd</sup> Actual Reason.</span><br />
<span class="m1">4<sup>th</sup> Perception of Universal concepts.</span><br />
<br />
B. Practical Reason—<br />
<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_186"></a><a href="images/186.png" class="pgno">[Pg 186]</a></span>
<span class="m1">1<sup>st</sup> External Purification.</span><br />
<span class="m1">2<sup>nd</sup> Internal Purification.</span><br />
<span class="m1">3<sup>rd</sup> Formation of virtuous habits.</span><br />
<span class="m1">4<sup>th</sup> Union with God.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Thus the spirit rises higher and higher in
the scale of being, and finally shares in the
eternity of the Absolute Light by losing itself
in its universality. "In itself non-existent, but
existent in the eternal Friend: how wonderful
that it <i>is</i> and <i>is not</i> at the same time". But
is the spirit free to choose its course? Hādī
criticises the Rationalists for their setting up
man as an independent creator of evil, and
accuses them of what he calls "veiled dualism".
He holds that every object has two sides—"bright"
side, and "dark" side. Things are
combinations of light and darkness. All good
flows from the side of light; evil proceeds
from darkness. Man, therefore, is both free
and determined.</p>

<p>But all the various lines of Persian thought
once more find a synthesis in that great
religious movement of Modern Persia—Bābism
or Bahāism, which began as a <span class="u">Sh</span>ī‘ah sect,
with Mirzā ‘Alī Muḥammad Bāb of <span class="u">Sh</span>īrāz
(b. 1820), and became less and less Islamic
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_187"></a><a href="images/187.png" class="pgno">[Pg 187]</a></span>
in character with the progress of orthodox
persecutions. The origin of the philosophy of
this wonderful sect must be sought in the
<span class="u">Sh</span>ī‘ah sect of the <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>īs, the founder of which,
<span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span> Aḥmad, was an enthusiastic student of
Mulla Ṣadrā's Philosophy, on which he had
written several commentaries. This sect differed
from the ordinary <span class="u">Sh</span>ī‘ahs in holding that belief
in an ever present Medium between the absent
Imām (the 12<sup>th</sup> Head of the Church, whose
manifestation is anxiously expected by the
<ins class="mycorr" title="S̱ẖī’ahs"><span class="u">Sh</span>ī‘ahs</ins>), and the church is a fundamental
principle of the <span class="u">Sh</span>ī‘ah religion. <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span> Aḥmad
claimed to be such a Medium; and when,
after the death of the second <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>ī Medium—Ḥājī
Kāzim, the <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>īs were anxiously expecting
the manifestation of the new Medium, Mirzā
‘Alī Muḥammad Bāb, who had attended the
lectures of Ḥājī Kāzim at Karbalā, proclaimed
himself the expected Medium, and many
<span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>īs accepted him.</p>

<p>The young Persian seer looks upon Reality
as an essence which brooks no distinction of
substance and attribute. The first bounty or
self-expansion of the Ultimate Essence, he
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_188"></a><a href="images/188.png" class="pgno">[Pg 188]</a></span>
says, is Existence. "Existence" is the "known",
the "known" is the essence of "knowledge";
"knowledge" is "will"; and "will" is "love".
Thus from Mulla Ṣadrā's identity of the known
and the knower, he passes to his conception
of the Real as Will and Love. This Primal
Love, which he regards as the essence of
the Real, is the cause of the manifestation of
the Universe which is nothing more than the
self-expansion of Love. The word creation,
with him, does not mean creation out of
nothing; since, as the <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>īs maintain, the
word creator is not peculiarly applicable to
God alone. The Quranic verse, that "God is
the best of creators",<a id="FNanchor_188:1_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_188:1_135" class="fnanchor">[188:1]</a> implies that there are
other self-manifesting beings like God.</p>

<p>After the execution of ‘Alī Muḥammad Bāb,
Bahāullāh, one of his principal disciples who
were collectively called "The First Unity",
took up the mission, and proclaimed himself
the originator of the new dispensation, the
absent Imām whose manifestation the Bāb
had foretold. He freed the doctrine of his master
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_189"></a><a href="images/189.png" class="pgno">[Pg 189]</a></span>
from its literalistic mysticism, and presented
it in a more perfected and systematised form.
The Absolute Reality, according to him, is
not a person; it is an eternal living Essence,
to which we apply the epithets Truth and
Love only because these are the highest
conceptions known to us. The Living Essence
manifests itself through the Univere with the
object of creating in itself atoms or centres of
consciousness, which as Dr. McTaggart would
say, constitute a further determination of the
Hegelian Absolute. In each of these undifferentiated,
simple centres of consciousness, there
is hidden a ray of the Absolute Light itself,
and the perfection of the spirit consists in
gradually actualising, by contact with the
individualising principle—matter, its emotional
and intellectual possibilities, and thus discovering
its own deep being—the ray of eternal Love
which is concealed by its union with consciousness.
The essence of man, therefore, is
not reason or consciousness; it is this ray of
Love—the source of all impulse to noble
and unselfish action, which constitutes the real
man. The influence of Mulla Ṣadrā's doctrine
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_190"></a><a href="images/190.png" class="pgno">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of the incorporeality of Imagination is here
apparent. Reason, which stands higher than
Imagination in the scale of evolution, is not a
necessary condition, according to Mulla Ṣadrā,
of immortality. In all forms of life there is an
immortal spiritual part, the ray of Eternal
Love, which has no necessary connection with
self-consciousness or reason, and survives after
the death of the body. Salvation, then, which
to Buddha consists in the starving out of the
mind-atoms by extinguishing desire, to Bahāullāh
lies in the discovery of the essence of love
which is hidden in the atoms of consciousness
themselves.<a id="FNanchor_190:1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_190:1_136" class="fnanchor">[190:1]</a> Both, however, agree that after
death thoughts and characters of men remain,
subject to other forces of a similar character,
in the spiritual world, waiting for another
opportunity to find a suitable physical accompaniment
in order to continue the process
of discovery (Bahāullāh) or destruction (Buddha).
To Bahāullāh the conception of Love is higher
than the conception of Will. Schopenhauer
conceived reality as Will which was driven to
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_191"></a><a href="images/191.png" class="pgno">[Pg 191]</a></span>
objectification by a sinful bent eternally existing
in its nature. Love or Will, according to both,
is present in every atom of life; but the
cause of its being there is the joy of self-expansion
in the one case, and the inexplicable
evil inclination in the other. But Schopenhauer
postulates certain temporal ideas in order to
account for the objectification of the Primordial
Will; Bahāullāh, as far as I can see, does not
explain the principle according to which the
self-manifestation of the Eternal Love is
realised in the Universe.</p>

<h3><a id="CONCLUSION"></a>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>Let us now briefly sum up the results of
our survey. We have seen that the Persian
mind had to struggle against two different
kinds of Dualism—pre-Islamic Magian Dualism,
and post-Islamic Greek Dualism, though the
fundamental problem of the diversity of things
remains essentially the same. The attitude of
the pre-Islamic Persian thinkers is thoroughly
objective, and hence the results of their intellectual
efforts are more or less materialistic. The
Pre-Islamic thinkers, however, clearly perceived
that the original Principle must be dynamically
conceived. With Zoroaster both the primary
spirits are "active", with Mānī the principle
of Light is passive, and the principle of Darkness
is aggressive. But their analysis of the
various elements which constitute the Universe
is ridiculously meagre; their conception of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_193"></a><a href="images/193.png" class="pgno">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Universe is most defective on its statical side.
There are, therefore, two weak points in their
systems:—</p>

<p><span class="m1">1. Naked Dualism.</span></p>

<p><span class="m1">2. Lack of analysis.</span></p>

<p>The first was remedied by Islām; the second
by the introduction of Greek Philosophy. The
advent of Islām and the study of Greek
philosophy, however, checked the indigenous
tendency towards monistic thought; but these
two forces contributed to change the objective
attitude characteristic of early thinkers, and
aroused the slumbering subjectivity, which
eventually reached its climax in the extreme
Pantheism of some of the Ṣūfī schools. Al-Fārābī
endeavoured to get rid of the dualism between
God and matter, by reducing matter to a mere
confused perception of the spirit; the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite
denied it altogether, and maintained a thoroughgoing
Idealism. The followers of Aristotle
continued to stick to their master's Prima
Materia; the Ṣūfīs looked upon the material
universe as a mere illusion, or a necessary
"other," for the self-knowledge of God. It can,
however, be safely stated that with the A<span class="u">sh</span>‘arite
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_194"></a><a href="images/194.png" class="pgno">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Idealism, the Persian mind got over the foreign
dualism of God and matter, and, fortified with
new philosophical ideas, returned to the old
dualism of light and darkness. The <span class="u">Sh</span>ai<span class="u">kh</span>-al-I<span class="u">sh</span>rāq
combines the objective attitude of
Pre-Islamic Persian thinkers with the subjective
attitude of his immediate predecessors, and
restates the Dualism of Zoroaster in a much
more philosophical and spiritualised form. His
system recognises the claims of both the subject
and the object. But all these monistic systems
of thought were met by the Pluralism of
Wāḥid Maḥmūd, who taught that reality is
not one, but many—primary living units
which combine in various ways, and gradually
rise to perfection by passing through an ascending
scale of forms. The reaction of Wāḥid
Maḥmūd was, however, an ephemeral phenomenon.
The later Sūfīs as well as philosophers
proper gradually transformed or abandoned the
Neo-Platonic theory of Emanation, and in later
thinkers we see a movement through Neo-Platonism
towards real Platonism which is
approached by Mulla Hādī's Philosophy. But
pure speculation and dreamy mysticism undergo
<span class='pagenum'><a id="Page_195"></a><a href="images/195.png" class="pgno">[Pg 195]</a></span>
a powerful check in Bābism which, unmindful
of persecution, synthesises all the inherited
philosophical and religious tendencies, and rouses
the spirit to a consciousness of the stern reality
of things. Though extremely cosmopolitan
and hence quite unpatriotic in character, it
has yet had a great influence over the Persian
mind. The unmystic character and the practical
tone of Bābism may have been a remote
cause of the progress of recent political reform
in Persia.</p>
